Psa|142|1|
I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
Psa|142|2|
I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
Psa|142|3|
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
Psa|142|4|
I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
Psa|142|5|
I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
Psa|142|6|
Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
Psa|142|7|
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
Psa|143|1|
Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
Psa|143|2|
And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
Psa|143|3|
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
Psa|143|4|
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
Psa|143|5|
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
Psa|143|6|
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
Psa|143|7|
Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
Psa|143|8|
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Psa|143|9|
Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
Psa|143|10|
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
Psa|143|11|
Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
Psa|143|12|
And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
Psa|144|1|
Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:
Psa|144|2|
My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
Psa|144|3|
LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
Psa|144|4|
Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
Psa|144|5|
Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Psa|144|6|
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
Psa|144|7|
Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
Psa|144|8|
Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
Psa|144|9|
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
Psa|144|10|
It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
Psa|144|11|
Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:
Psa|144|12|
That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
Psa|144|13|
That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:
Psa|144|14|
That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.
Psa|144|15|
Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.
