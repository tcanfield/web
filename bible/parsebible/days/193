Pro|7|1|
My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
Pro|7|2|
Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
Pro|7|3|
Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
Pro|7|4|
Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
Pro|7|5|
That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.
Pro|7|6|
For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
Pro|7|7|
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
Pro|7|8|
Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
Pro|7|9|
In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
Pro|7|10|
And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
Pro|7|11|
(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
Pro|7|12|
Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
Pro|7|13|
So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
Pro|7|14|
I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
Pro|7|15|
Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
Pro|7|16|
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
Pro|7|17|
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Pro|7|18|
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
Pro|7|19|
For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
Pro|7|20|
He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
Pro|7|21|
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
Pro|7|22|
He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
Pro|7|23|
Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
Pro|7|24|
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Pro|7|25|
Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
Pro|7|26|
For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
Pro|7|27|
Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
Pro|8|1|
Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
Pro|8|2|
She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
Pro|8|3|
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
Pro|8|4|
Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
Pro|8|5|
O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
Pro|8|6|
Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
Pro|8|7|
For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
Pro|8|8|
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.
Pro|8|9|
They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
Pro|8|10|
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
Pro|8|11|
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
Pro|8|12|
I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
Pro|8|13|
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
Pro|8|14|
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
Pro|8|15|
By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
Pro|8|16|
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
Pro|8|17|
I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
Pro|8|18|
Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
Pro|8|19|
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
Pro|8|20|
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
Pro|8|21|
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
Pro|8|22|
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
Pro|8|23|
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
Pro|8|24|
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
Pro|8|25|
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
Pro|8|26|
While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
Pro|8|27|
When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
Pro|8|28|
When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
Pro|8|29|
When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
Pro|8|30|
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
Pro|8|31|
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
Pro|8|32|
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
Pro|8|33|
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
Pro|8|34|
Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
Pro|8|35|
For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
Pro|8|36|
But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
Pro|9|1|
Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
Pro|9|2|
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
Pro|9|3|
She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
Pro|9|4|
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
Pro|9|5|
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Pro|9|6|
Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
Pro|9|7|
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
Pro|9|8|
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
Pro|9|9|
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
Pro|9|10|
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
Pro|9|11|
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
Pro|9|12|
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
Pro|9|13|
A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
Pro|9|14|
For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
Pro|9|15|
To call passengers who go right on their ways:
Pro|9|16|
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
Pro|9|17|
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
Pro|9|18|
But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
Pro|10|1|
The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
Pro|10|2|
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.
Pro|10|3|
The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
Pro|10|4|
He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
Pro|10|5|
He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.
Pro|10|6|
Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
Pro|10|7|
The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.
Pro|10|8|
The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.
Pro|10|9|
He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
Pro|10|10|
He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.
Pro|10|11|
The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
Pro|10|12|
Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.
Pro|10|13|
In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
Pro|10|14|
Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.
Pro|10|15|
The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
Pro|10|16|
The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.
Pro|10|17|
He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.
Pro|10|18|
He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.
Pro|10|19|
In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.
Pro|10|20|
The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.
Pro|10|21|
The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.
Pro|10|22|
The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
Pro|10|23|
It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.
Pro|10|24|
The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
Pro|10|25|
As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
Pro|10|26|
As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.
Pro|10|27|
The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
Pro|10|28|
The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
Pro|10|29|
The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
Pro|10|30|
The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.
Pro|10|31|
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.
Pro|10|32|
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.
