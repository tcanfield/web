Psa|62|1|
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
Psa|62|2|
He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
Psa|62|3|
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
Psa|62|4|
They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
Psa|62|5|
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
Psa|62|6|
He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
Psa|62|7|
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
Psa|62|8|
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
Psa|62|9|
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
Psa|62|10|
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
Psa|62|11|
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
Psa|62|12|
Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
Psa|63|1|
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
Psa|63|2|
To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
Psa|63|3|
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
Psa|63|4|
Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
Psa|63|5|
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
Psa|63|6|
When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
Psa|63|7|
Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
Psa|63|8|
My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
Psa|63|9|
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
Psa|63|10|
They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
Psa|63|11|
But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
Psa|64|1|
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Psa|64|2|
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
Psa|64|3|
Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:
Psa|64|4|
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
Psa|64|5|
They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
Psa|64|6|
They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
Psa|64|7|
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
Psa|64|8|
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
Psa|64|9|
And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
Psa|64|10|
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
Psa|65|1|
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
Psa|65|2|
O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
Psa|65|3|
Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
Psa|65|4|
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
Psa|65|5|
By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:
Psa|65|6|
Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:
Psa|65|7|
Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
Psa|65|8|
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
Psa|65|9|
Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
Psa|65|10|
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
Psa|65|11|
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
Psa|65|12|
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
Psa|65|13|
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
