Psa|103|1|
Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
Psa|103|2|
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
Psa|103|3|
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
Psa|103|4|
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
Psa|103|5|
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
Psa|103|6|
The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
Psa|103|7|
He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
Psa|103|8|
The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
Psa|103|9|
He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
Psa|103|10|
He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
Psa|103|11|
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
Psa|103|12|
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
Psa|103|13|
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
Psa|103|14|
For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
Psa|103|15|
As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
Psa|103|16|
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
Psa|103|17|
But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
Psa|103|18|
To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
Psa|103|19|
The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
Psa|103|20|
Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
Psa|103|21|
Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
Psa|103|22|
Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
Psa|104|1|
Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
Psa|104|2|
Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
Psa|104|3|
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
Psa|104|4|
Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
Psa|104|5|
Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
Psa|104|6|
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
Psa|104|7|
At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
Psa|104|8|
They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
Psa|104|9|
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
Psa|104|10|
He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
Psa|104|11|
They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
Psa|104|12|
By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
Psa|104|13|
He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
Psa|104|14|
He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
Psa|104|15|
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
Psa|104|16|
The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
Psa|104|17|
Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
Psa|104|18|
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
Psa|104|19|
He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
Psa|104|20|
Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
Psa|104|21|
The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
Psa|104|22|
The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
Psa|104|23|
Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
Psa|104|24|
O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
Psa|104|25|
So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
Psa|104|26|
There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
Psa|104|27|
These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
Psa|104|28|
That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
Psa|104|29|
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Psa|104|30|
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
Psa|104|31|
The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
Psa|104|32|
He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
Psa|104|33|
I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Psa|104|34|
My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
Psa|104|35|
Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa|105|1|
O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
Psa|105|2|
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
Psa|105|3|
Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
Psa|105|4|
Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Psa|105|5|
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
Psa|105|6|
O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
Psa|105|7|
He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
Psa|105|8|
He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
Psa|105|9|
Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
Psa|105|10|
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
Psa|105|11|
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
Psa|105|12|
When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
Psa|105|13|
When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
Psa|105|14|
He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
Psa|105|15|
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
Psa|105|16|
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
Psa|105|17|
He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
Psa|105|18|
Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
Psa|105|19|
Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
Psa|105|20|
The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
Psa|105|21|
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
Psa|105|22|
To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
Psa|105|23|
Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psa|105|24|
And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
Psa|105|25|
He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
Psa|105|26|
He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psa|105|27|
They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
Psa|105|28|
He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
Psa|105|29|
He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Psa|105|30|
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
Psa|105|31|
He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.
Psa|105|32|
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
Psa|105|33|
He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
Psa|105|34|
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
Psa|105|35|
And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
Psa|105|36|
He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
Psa|105|37|
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
Psa|105|38|
Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
Psa|105|39|
He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
Psa|105|40|
The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psa|105|41|
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.
Psa|105|42|
For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
Psa|105|43|
And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:
Psa|105|44|
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
Psa|105|45|
That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
