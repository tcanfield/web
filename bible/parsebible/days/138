Job|19|1|
Then Job answered and said,
Job|19|2|
How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
Job|19|3|
These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
Job|19|4|
And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
Job|19|5|
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
Job|19|6|
Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
Job|19|7|
Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
Job|19|8|
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
Job|19|9|
He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
Job|19|10|
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
Job|19|11|
He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
Job|19|12|
His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
Job|19|13|
He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
Job|19|14|
My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
Job|19|15|
They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
Job|19|16|
I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
Job|19|17|
My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.
Job|19|18|
Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
Job|19|19|
All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
Job|19|20|
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
Job|19|21|
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
Job|19|22|
Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
Job|19|23|
Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
Job|19|24|
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
Job|19|25|
For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
Job|19|26|
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
Job|19|27|
Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
Job|19|28|
But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
Job|19|29|
Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
Job|20|1|
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
Job|20|2|
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
Job|20|3|
I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
Job|20|4|
Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
Job|20|5|
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
Job|20|6|
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
Job|20|7|
Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
Job|20|8|
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
Job|20|9|
The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
Job|20|10|
His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
Job|20|11|
His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
Job|20|12|
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;
Job|20|13|
Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
Job|20|14|
Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
Job|20|15|
He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
Job|20|16|
He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
Job|20|17|
He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
Job|20|18|
That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
Job|20|19|
Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
Job|20|20|
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
Job|20|21|
There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
Job|20|22|
In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
Job|20|23|
When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
Job|20|24|
He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
Job|20|25|
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
Job|20|26|
All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
Job|20|27|
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
Job|20|28|
The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
Job|20|29|
This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
Job|21|1|
But Job answered and said,
Job|21|2|
Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
Job|21|3|
Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
Job|21|4|
As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
Job|21|5|
Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
Job|21|6|
Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
Job|21|7|
Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
Job|21|8|
Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
Job|21|9|
Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
Job|21|10|
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
Job|21|11|
They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
Job|21|12|
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
Job|21|13|
They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
Job|21|14|
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
Job|21|15|
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
Job|21|16|
Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job|21|17|
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
Job|21|18|
They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
Job|21|19|
God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
Job|21|20|
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job|21|21|
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
Job|21|22|
Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
Job|21|23|
One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
Job|21|24|
His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
Job|21|25|
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
Job|21|26|
They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
Job|21|27|
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
Job|21|28|
For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
Job|21|29|
Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
Job|21|30|
That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
Job|21|31|
Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job|21|32|
Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
Job|21|33|
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
Job|21|34|
How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
