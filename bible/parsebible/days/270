Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
Amo|6|4|
That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
Amo|6|5|
That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;

Amo|6|14|
But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.
