Ti2|3|1|
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
Ti2|3|2|
For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
Ti2|3|3|
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
Ti2|3|4|
Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
Ti2|3|5|
Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
Ti2|3|6|
For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
Ti2|3|7|
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
Ti2|3|8|
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
Ti2|3|9|
But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was.
Ti2|3|10|
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
Ti2|3|11|
Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.
Ti2|3|12|
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
Ti2|3|13|
But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
Ti2|3|14|
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
Ti2|3|15|
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
Ti2|3|16|
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
Ti2|3|17|
That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
Ti2|4|1|
I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
Ti2|4|2|
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
Ti2|4|3|
For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
Ti2|4|4|
And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
Ti2|4|5|
But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
Ti2|4|6|
For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
Ti2|4|7|
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
Ti2|4|8|
Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
Ti2|4|9|
Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
Ti2|4|10|
For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
Ti2|4|11|
Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
Ti2|4|12|
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
Ti2|4|13|
The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.
Ti2|4|14|
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
Ti2|4|15|
Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
Ti2|4|16|
At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.
Ti2|4|17|
Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
Ti2|4|18|
And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Ti2|4|19|
Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
Ti2|4|20|
Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
Ti2|4|21|
Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
Ti2|4|22|
The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
Tit|1|1|
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
Tit|1|2|
In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
Tit|1|3|
But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
Tit|1|4|
To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
Tit|1|5|
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
Tit|1|6|
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
Tit|1|7|
For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
Tit|1|8|
But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
Tit|1|9|
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
Tit|1|10|
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
Tit|1|11|
Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
Tit|1|12|
One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
Tit|1|13|
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
Tit|1|14|
Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
Tit|1|15|
Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
Tit|1|16|
They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
