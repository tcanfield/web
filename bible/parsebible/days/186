By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
Psa|137|2|
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
Psa|137|3|
For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
