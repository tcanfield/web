Job|22|1|
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
Job|22|2|
Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
Job|22|3|
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
Job|22|4|
Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
Job|22|5|
Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?
Job|22|6|
For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
Job|22|7|
Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
Job|22|8|
But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
Job|22|9|
Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
Job|22|10|
Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
Job|22|11|
Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
Job|22|12|
Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
Job|22|13|
And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
Job|22|14|
Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
Job|22|15|
Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
Job|22|16|
Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
Job|22|17|
Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
Job|22|18|
Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job|22|19|
The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
Job|22|20|
Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
Job|22|21|
Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
Job|22|22|
Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
Job|22|23|
If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
Job|22|24|
Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
Job|22|25|
Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
Job|22|26|
For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
Job|22|27|
Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
Job|22|28|
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
Job|22|29|
When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
Job|22|30|
He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
Job|23|1|
Then Job answered and said,
Job|23|2|
Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job|23|3|
Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
Job|23|4|
I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job|23|5|
I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
Job|23|6|
Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
Job|23|7|
There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job|23|8|
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
Job|23|9|
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
Job|23|10|
But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
Job|23|11|
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
Job|23|12|
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job|23|13|
But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
Job|23|14|
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
Job|23|15|
Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
Job|23|16|
For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
Job|23|17|
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
Job|24|1|
Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
Job|24|2|
Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
Job|24|3|
They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
Job|24|4|
They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
Job|24|5|
Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
Job|24|6|
They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
Job|24|7|
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
Job|24|8|
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
Job|24|9|
They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
Job|24|10|
They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
Job|24|11|
Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
Job|24|12|
Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
Job|24|13|
They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
Job|24|14|
The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
Job|24|15|
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
Job|24|16|
In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
Job|24|17|
For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
Job|24|18|
He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
Job|24|19|
Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.
Job|24|20|
The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
Job|24|21|
He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
Job|24|22|
He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
Job|24|23|
Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.
Job|24|24|
They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
Job|24|25|
And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
Job|25|1|
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|25|2|
Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
Job|25|3|
Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job|25|4|
How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job|25|5|
Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.
Job|25|6|
How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?
