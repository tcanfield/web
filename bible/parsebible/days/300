Luk|8|1|
And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,
Luk|8|2|
And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
Luk|8|3|
And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.
Luk|8|4|
And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:
Luk|8|5|
A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
Luk|8|6|
And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
Luk|8|7|
And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
Luk|8|8|
And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luk|8|9|
And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
Luk|8|10|
And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
Luk|8|11|
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luk|8|12|
Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
Luk|8|13|
They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
Luk|8|14|
And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
Luk|8|15|
But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
Luk|8|16|
No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.
Luk|8|17|
For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.
Luk|8|18|
Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.
Luk|8|19|
Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.
Luk|8|20|
And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
Luk|8|21|
And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
Luk|8|22|
Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
Luk|8|23|
But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.
Luk|8|24|
And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luk|8|25|
And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
Luk|8|26|
And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
Luk|8|27|
And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.
Luk|8|28|
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.
Luk|8|29|
(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)
Luk|8|30|
And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.
Luk|8|31|
And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
Luk|8|32|
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.
Luk|8|33|
Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
Luk|8|34|
When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.
Luk|8|35|
Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
Luk|8|36|
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
Luk|8|37|
Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.
Luk|8|38|
Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
Luk|8|39|
Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.
Luk|8|40|
And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.
Luk|8|41|
And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:
Luk|8|42|
For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
Luk|8|43|
And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
Luk|8|44|
Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
Luk|8|45|
And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
Luk|8|46|
And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
Luk|8|47|
And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
Luk|8|48|
And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
Luk|8|49|
While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
Luk|8|50|
But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.
Luk|8|51|
And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
Luk|8|52|
And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
Luk|8|53|
And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
Luk|8|54|
And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
Luk|8|55|
And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
Luk|8|56|
And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
Luk|9|1|
Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
Luk|9|2|
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
Luk|9|3|
And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.
Luk|9|4|
And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.
Luk|9|5|
And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
Luk|9|6|
And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
Luk|9|7|
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;
Luk|9|8|
And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
Luk|9|9|
And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
Luk|9|10|
And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
Luk|9|11|
And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.
Luk|9|12|
And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
Luk|9|13|
But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.
Luk|9|14|
For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
Luk|9|15|
And they did so, and made them all sit down.
Luk|9|16|
Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
Luk|9|17|
And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
Luk|9|18|
And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
Luk|9|19|
They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
Luk|9|20|
He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
Luk|9|21|
And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;
Luk|9|22|
Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
Luk|9|23|
And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
Luk|9|24|
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
Luk|9|25|
For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
Luk|9|26|
For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.
Luk|9|27|
But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
Luk|9|28|
And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
Luk|9|29|
And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
Luk|9|30|
And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:
Luk|9|31|
Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
Luk|9|32|
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
Luk|9|33|
And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
Luk|9|34|
While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
Luk|9|35|
And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
Luk|9|36|
And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
Luk|9|37|
And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.
Luk|9|38|
And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.
Luk|9|39|
And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.
Luk|9|40|
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
Luk|9|41|
And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.
Luk|9|42|
And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
Luk|9|43|
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
Luk|9|44|
Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
Luk|9|45|
But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
Luk|9|46|
Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
Luk|9|47|
And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
Luk|9|48|
And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
Luk|9|49|
And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.
Luk|9|50|
And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.
Luk|9|51|
And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
Luk|9|52|
And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
Luk|9|53|
And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
Luk|9|54|
And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
Luk|9|55|
But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
Luk|9|56|
For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.
Luk|9|57|
And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Luk|9|58|
And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
Luk|9|59|
And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Luk|9|60|
Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
Luk|9|61|
And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.
Luk|9|62|
And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
Luk|10|1|
After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.
Luk|10|2|
Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.
Luk|10|3|
Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
Luk|10|4|
Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.
Luk|10|5|
And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
Luk|10|6|
And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.
Luk|10|7|
And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
Luk|10|8|
And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
Luk|10|9|
And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
Luk|10|10|
But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,
Luk|10|11|
Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
Luk|10|12|
But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
Luk|10|13|
Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luk|10|14|
But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.
Luk|10|15|
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.
Luk|10|16|
He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.
Luk|10|17|
And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.
Luk|10|18|
And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Luk|10|19|
Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
Luk|10|20|
Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
Luk|10|21|
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.
Luk|10|22|
All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.
Luk|10|23|
And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:
Luk|10|24|
For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
Luk|10|25|
And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luk|10|26|
He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
Luk|10|27|
And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
Luk|10|28|
And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
Luk|10|29|
But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
Luk|10|30|
And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
Luk|10|31|
And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
Luk|10|32|
And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
Luk|10|33|
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,
Luk|10|34|
And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
Luk|10|35|
And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.
Luk|10|36|
Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?
Luk|10|37|
And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
Luk|10|38|
Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
Luk|10|39|
And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.
Luk|10|40|
But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?  bid her therefore that she help me.
Luk|10|41|
And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:
Luk|10|42|
But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
