The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
Psa|93|2|
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
Psa|93|3|
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
Psa|93|4|
The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
Psa|93|5|

Psa|94|1|
O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
Psa|94|2|
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
Psa|94|3|
LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
Psa|94|4|
How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
Psa|94|5|
They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
Psa|94|6|
They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
Psa|94|7|
Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
Psa|94|8|

Psa|94|9|
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
Psa|94|10|
He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
Psa|94|11|

Psa|94|12|
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;
Psa|94|13|
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
Psa|94|14|
For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
Psa|94|15|
But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
Psa|94|16|
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Psa|94|17|
Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
Psa|94|18|
When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
Psa|94|19|
In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
Psa|94|20|
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
Psa|94|21|
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
Psa|94|22|
But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
Psa|94|23|
And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
Psa|95|1|
O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
Psa|95|2|
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.

Psa|95|7|
For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
Psa|95|8|
Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
Psa|95|9|
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
Psa|95|10|
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
Psa|95|11|
Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
Psa|96|1|
O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
Psa|96|2|
Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
Psa|96|3|
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
Psa|96|4|
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.

Psa|96|7|
Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
Psa|96|8|
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
Psa|96|9|
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
Psa|96|10|
Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
Psa|96|11|
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
Psa|96|12|
Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
Psa|96|13|
Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
