Psa|109|1|
Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
Psa|109|2|
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
Psa|109|3|
They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
Psa|109|4|
For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.
Psa|109|5|
And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Psa|109|6|
Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
Psa|109|7|
When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
Psa|109|8|
Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
Psa|109|9|
Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Psa|109|10|
Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
Psa|109|11|
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Psa|109|12|
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
Psa|109|13|
Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
Psa|109|14|
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Psa|109|15|
Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
Psa|109|16|
Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
Psa|109|17|
As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
Psa|109|18|
As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Psa|109|19|
Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
Psa|109|20|
Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
Psa|109|21|
But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
Psa|109|22|
For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Psa|109|23|
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
Psa|109|24|
My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
Psa|109|25|
I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
Psa|109|26|
Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
Psa|109|27|
That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.
Psa|109|28|
Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
Psa|109|29|
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
Psa|109|30|
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
Psa|109|31|
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
Psa|110|1|
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Psa|110|2|
The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Psa|110|3|
Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
Psa|110|4|
The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
Psa|110|5|
The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
Psa|110|6|
He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
Psa|110|7|
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
Psa|111|1|
Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
Psa|111|2|
The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
Psa|111|3|
His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Psa|111|4|
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
Psa|111|5|
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
Psa|111|6|
He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
Psa|111|7|
The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
Psa|111|8|
They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
Psa|111|9|
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
Psa|111|10|
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
Psa|112|1|
Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
Psa|112|2|
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Psa|112|3|
Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Psa|112|4|
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
Psa|112|5|
A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
Psa|112|6|
Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
Psa|112|7|
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
Psa|112|8|
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.
Psa|112|9|
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
Psa|112|10|
The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
