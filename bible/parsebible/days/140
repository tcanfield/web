Job|26|1|
But Job answered and said,
Job|26|2|
How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
Job|26|3|
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
Job|26|4|
To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
Job|26|5|
Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
Job|26|6|
Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
Job|26|7|
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
Job|26|8|
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
Job|26|9|
He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
Job|26|10|
He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
Job|26|11|
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
Job|26|12|
He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
Job|26|13|
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
Job|26|14|
Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
Job|27|1|
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
Job|27|2|
As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
Job|27|3|
All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
Job|27|4|
My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
Job|27|5|
God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
Job|27|6|
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
Job|27|7|
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
Job|27|8|
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
Job|27|9|
Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
Job|27|10|
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
Job|27|11|
I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job|27|12|
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
Job|27|13|
This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
Job|27|14|
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Job|27|15|
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
Job|27|16|
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
Job|27|17|
He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
Job|27|18|
He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
Job|27|19|
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
Job|27|20|
Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
Job|27|21|
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
Job|27|22|
For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
Job|27|23|
Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
Job|28|1|
Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
Job|28|2|
Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.
Job|28|3|
He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
Job|28|4|
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
Job|28|5|
As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
Job|28|6|
The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
Job|28|7|
There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
Job|28|8|
The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
Job|28|9|
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
Job|28|10|
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job|28|11|
He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job|28|12|
But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
Job|28|13|
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job|28|14|
The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
Job|28|15|
It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
Job|28|16|
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
Job|28|17|
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
Job|28|18|
No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
Job|28|19|
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
Job|28|20|
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
Job|28|21|
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
Job|28|22|
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
Job|28|23|
God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
Job|28|24|
For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
Job|28|25|
To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
Job|28|26|
When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
Job|28|27|
Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
Job|28|28|
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
