Psa|116|5|
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
Psa|116|6|
The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
Psa|116|7|
Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
Psa|116|8|
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
Psa|116|9|
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
Psa|116|10|
I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
Psa|116|13|
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa|116|14|
I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Psa|116|15|

Psa|116|17|
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa|116|18|

Psa|118|4|
Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa|118|5|
I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.
Psa|118|6|
The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
Psa|118|7|
The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
Psa|118|8|

All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
Psa|118|11|
They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
Psa|118|12|
They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
Psa|118|13|
Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
Psa|118|14|
The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
Psa|118|15|
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
Psa|118|16|
The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
Psa|118|17|
I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
Psa|118|18|
The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.
Psa|118|19|
Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:
Psa|118|20|
This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
Psa|118|21|
I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
Psa|118|22|
The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.
Psa|118|23|
This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
Psa|118|24|
This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Psa|118|25|
Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.
Psa|118|26|
Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.
Psa|118|27|
God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
Psa|118|28|
Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
Psa|118|29|
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
