Job|5|1|
Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
Job|5|2|
For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
Job|5|3|
I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job|5|4|
His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
Job|5|5|
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
Job|5|6|
Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
Job|5|7|
Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
Job|5|8|
I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
Job|5|9|
Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
Job|5|10|
Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
Job|5|11|
To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
Job|5|12|
He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
Job|5|13|
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
Job|5|14|
They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
Job|5|15|
But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
Job|5|16|
So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
Job|5|17|
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
Job|5|18|
For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
Job|5|19|
He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
Job|5|20|
In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
Job|5|21|
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job|5|22|
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job|5|23|
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job|5|24|
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
Job|5|25|
Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
Job|5|26|
Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
Job|5|27|
Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
Job|6|1|
But Job answered and said,
Job|6|2|
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
Job|6|3|
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
Job|6|4|
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
Job|6|5|
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job|6|6|
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job|6|7|
The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
Job|6|8|
Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
Job|6|9|
Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
Job|6|10|
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
Job|6|11|
What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
Job|6|12|
Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
Job|6|13|
Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
Job|6|14|
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job|6|15|
My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
Job|6|16|
Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
Job|6|17|
What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
Job|6|18|
The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
Job|6|19|
The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
Job|6|20|
They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
Job|6|21|
For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
Job|6|22|
Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
Job|6|23|
Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
Job|6|24|
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
Job|6|25|
How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
Job|6|26|
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
Job|6|27|
Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
Job|6|28|
Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
Job|6|29|
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
Job|6|30|
Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
Job|7|1|
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
Job|7|2|
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:
Job|7|3|
So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
Job|7|4|
When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
Job|7|5|
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
Job|7|6|
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
Job|7|7|
O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
Job|7|8|
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
Job|7|9|
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
Job|7|10|
He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
Job|7|11|
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job|7|12|
Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
Job|7|13|
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;
Job|7|14|
Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
Job|7|15|
So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
Job|7|16|
I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
Job|7|17|
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
Job|7|18|
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
Job|7|19|
How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
Job|7|20|
I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
Job|7|21|
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
