Job|35|1|
Elihu spake moreover, and said,
Job|35|2|
Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
Job|35|3|
For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
Job|35|4|
I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
Job|35|5|
Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
Job|35|6|
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
Job|35|7|
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
Job|35|8|
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
Job|35|9|
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job|35|10|
But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
Job|35|11|
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
Job|35|12|
There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
Job|35|13|
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
Job|35|14|
Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
Job|35|15|
But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
Job|35|16|
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job|36|1|
Elihu also proceeded, and said,
Job|36|2|
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
Job|36|3|
I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job|36|4|
For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job|36|5|
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
Job|36|6|
He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
Job|36|7|
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
Job|36|8|
And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
Job|36|9|
Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
Job|36|10|
He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
Job|36|11|
If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
Job|36|12|
But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
Job|36|13|
But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
Job|36|14|
They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
Job|36|15|
He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
Job|36|16|
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
Job|36|17|
But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
Job|36|18|
Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
Job|36|19|
Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
Job|36|20|
Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
Job|36|21|
Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
Job|36|22|
Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
Job|36|23|
Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
Job|36|24|
Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
Job|36|25|
Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
Job|36|26|
Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
Job|36|27|
For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
Job|36|28|
Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
Job|36|29|
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
Job|36|30|
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
Job|36|31|
For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
Job|36|32|
With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
Job|36|33|
The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
Job|37|1|
At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
Job|37|2|
Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
Job|37|3|
He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
Job|37|4|
After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
Job|37|5|
God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
Job|37|6|
For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
Job|37|7|
He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job|37|8|
Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
Job|37|9|
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
Job|37|10|
By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job|37|11|
Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
Job|37|12|
And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
Job|37|13|
He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
Job|37|14|
Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
Job|37|15|
Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
Job|37|16|
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
Job|37|17|
How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
Job|37|18|
Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
Job|37|19|
Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
Job|37|20|
Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
Job|37|21|
And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
Job|37|22|
Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
Job|37|23|
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
Job|37|24|
Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
Job|38|1|
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job|38|2|
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Job|38|3|
Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
Job|38|4|
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
Job|38|5|
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
Job|38|6|
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
Job|38|7|
When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job|38|8|
Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
Job|38|9|
When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
Job|38|10|
And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
Job|38|11|
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
Job|38|12|
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
Job|38|13|
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
Job|38|14|
It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
Job|38|15|
And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
Job|38|16|
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
Job|38|17|
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
Job|38|18|
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
Job|38|19|
Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
Job|38|20|
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
Job|38|21|
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
Job|38|22|
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
Job|38|23|
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
Job|38|24|
By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
Job|38|25|
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
Job|38|26|
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
Job|38|27|
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
Job|38|28|
Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job|38|29|
Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
Job|38|30|
The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
Job|38|31|
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
Job|38|32|
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
Job|38|33|
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
Job|38|34|
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
Job|38|35|
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?
Job|38|36|
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
Job|38|37|
Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
Job|38|38|
When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
Job|38|39|
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
Job|38|40|
When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
Job|38|41|
Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
