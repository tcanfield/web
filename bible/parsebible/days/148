Psa|10|1|
Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
Psa|10|2|
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
Psa|10|3|
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
Psa|10|4|
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
Psa|10|5|
His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
Psa|10|6|
He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
Psa|10|7|
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
Psa|10|8|
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
Psa|10|9|
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
Psa|10|10|
He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
Psa|10|11|
He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
Psa|10|12|
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
Psa|10|13|
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
Psa|10|14|
Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
Psa|10|15|
Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
Psa|10|16|
The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
Psa|10|17|
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
Psa|10|18|
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
Psa|11|1|
In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?
Psa|11|2|
For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
Psa|11|3|
If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
Psa|11|4|
The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
Psa|11|5|
The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
Psa|11|6|
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
Psa|11|7|
For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
Psa|12|1|
Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
Psa|12|2|
They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
Psa|12|3|
The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
Psa|12|4|
Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
Psa|12|5|
For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
Psa|12|6|
The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
Psa|12|7|
Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
Psa|12|8|
The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
