Num|23|19|

Num|23|20|
Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

Num|24|5|
How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!

Num|24|13|

Num|25|10|

Num|25|11|
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
Num|25|12|
Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
