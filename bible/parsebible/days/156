Psa|37|1|
Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
Psa|37|2|
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
Psa|37|3|
Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
Psa|37|4|
Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
Psa|37|5|
Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
Psa|37|6|
And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
Psa|37|7|
Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
Psa|37|8|
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
Psa|37|9|
For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
Psa|37|10|
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
Psa|37|11|
But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
Psa|37|12|
The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
Psa|37|13|
The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
Psa|37|14|
The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.
Psa|37|15|
Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
Psa|37|16|
A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.
Psa|37|17|
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
Psa|37|18|
The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
Psa|37|19|
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
Psa|37|20|
But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
Psa|37|21|
The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
Psa|37|22|
For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
Psa|37|23|
The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.
Psa|37|24|
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
Psa|37|25|
I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
Psa|37|26|
He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
Psa|37|27|
Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
Psa|37|28|
For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
Psa|37|29|
The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
Psa|37|30|
The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
Psa|37|31|
The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
Psa|37|32|
The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
Psa|37|33|
The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
Psa|37|34|
Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
Psa|37|35|
I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
Psa|37|36|
Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
Psa|37|37|
Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.
Psa|37|38|
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
Psa|37|39|
But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.
Psa|37|40|
And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
Psa|38|1|
O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psa|38|2|
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
Psa|38|3|
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
Psa|38|4|
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
Psa|38|5|
My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
Psa|38|6|
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
Psa|38|7|
For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.
Psa|38|8|
I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
Psa|38|9|
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
Psa|38|10|
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
Psa|38|11|
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
Psa|38|12|
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
Psa|38|13|
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
Psa|38|14|
Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
Psa|38|15|
For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
Psa|38|16|
For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
Psa|38|17|
For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
Psa|38|18|
For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
Psa|38|19|
But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
Psa|38|20|
They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
Psa|38|21|
Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
Psa|38|22|
Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
Psa|39|1|
I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
Psa|39|2|
I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
Psa|39|3|
My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,
Psa|39|4|
LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.
Psa|39|5|
Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
Psa|39|6|
Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
Psa|39|7|
And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
Psa|39|8|
Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
Psa|39|9|
I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
Psa|39|10|
Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
Psa|39|11|
When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.
Psa|39|12|
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
Psa|39|13|
O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
Psa|40|1|
I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
Psa|40|2|
He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
Psa|40|3|
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
Psa|40|4|
Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
Psa|40|5|
Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
Psa|40|6|
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
Psa|40|7|
Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
Psa|40|8|
I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
Psa|40|9|
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
Psa|40|10|
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
Psa|40|11|
Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
Psa|40|12|
For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
Psa|40|13|
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
Psa|40|14|
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
Psa|40|15|
Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
Psa|40|16|
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
Psa|40|17|
But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
