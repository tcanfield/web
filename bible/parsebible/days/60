Jos|11|1|
And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
Jos|11|2|
And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,
Jos|11|3|
And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
Jos|11|4|
And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
Jos|11|5|
And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
Jos|11|6|
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
Jos|11|7|
So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
Jos|11|8|
And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
Jos|11|9|
And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
Jos|11|10|
And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
Jos|11|11|
And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
Jos|11|12|
And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
Jos|11|13|
But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
Jos|11|14|
And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
Jos|11|15|
As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
Jos|11|16|
So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
Jos|11|17|
Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
Jos|11|18|
Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Jos|11|19|
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
Jos|11|20|
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Jos|11|21|
And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
Jos|11|22|
There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
Jos|11|23|
So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.
Jos|12|1|
Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:
Jos|12|2|
Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
Jos|12|3|
And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:
Jos|12|4|
And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
Jos|12|5|
And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Jos|12|6|
Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.
Jos|12|7|
And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
Jos|12|8|
In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
Jos|12|9|
The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
Jos|12|10|
The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Jos|12|11|

The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
Jos|12|14|
The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
Jos|12|15|
The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
Jos|12|16|
The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
Jos|12|17|
The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Jos|12|18|
The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
Jos|12|19|
The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Jos|12|20|
The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Jos|12|21|
The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Jos|12|22|
The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;
Jos|12|23|
The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;
Jos|12|24|
The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
Jos|13|1|
Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
Jos|13|2|
This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
Jos|13|3|
From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
Jos|13|4|
From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:
Jos|13|5|
And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
Jos|13|6|
All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
Jos|13|7|
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
Jos|13|8|
With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
Jos|13|9|
From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
Jos|13|10|
And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
Jos|13|11|
And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;
Jos|13|12|
All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
Jos|13|13|
Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
Jos|13|14|
Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.
Jos|13|15|
And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.
Jos|13|16|
And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
Jos|13|17|
Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,
Jos|13|18|
And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
Jos|13|19|
And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,
Jos|13|20|
And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,
Jos|13|21|
And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
Jos|13|22|
Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.
Jos|13|23|
And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
Jos|13|24|
And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families.
Jos|13|25|
And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
Jos|13|26|
And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
Jos|13|27|
And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.
Jos|13|28|
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
Jos|13|29|
And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
Jos|13|30|
And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
Jos|13|31|
And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
Jos|13|32|
These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.
Jos|13|33|
But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.
