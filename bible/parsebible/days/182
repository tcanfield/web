Psa|123|1|
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Psa|123|2|
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
Psa|123|3|
Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Psa|123|4|
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
Psa|124|1|
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
Psa|124|2|
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
Psa|124|3|
Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
Psa|124|4|
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
Psa|124|5|
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
Psa|124|6|
Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Psa|124|7|
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
Psa|124|8|
Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
Psa|125|1|
They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.
Psa|125|2|
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
Psa|125|3|
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
Psa|125|4|
Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
Psa|125|5|
As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
