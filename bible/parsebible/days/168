Psa|75|1|
Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
Psa|75|2|
When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
Psa|75|3|
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
Psa|75|4|
I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
Psa|75|5|
Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
Psa|75|6|
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
Psa|75|7|
But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
Psa|75|8|
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
Psa|75|9|
But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Psa|75|10|
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
Psa|76|1|
In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
Psa|76|2|
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
Psa|76|3|
There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
Psa|76|4|
Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
Psa|76|5|
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
Psa|76|6|
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
Psa|76|7|
Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
Psa|76|8|
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
Psa|76|9|
When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
Psa|76|10|
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
Psa|76|11|
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
Psa|76|12|
He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
Psa|77|1|
I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
Psa|77|2|
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
Psa|77|3|
I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
Psa|77|4|
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
Psa|77|5|
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
Psa|77|6|
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
Psa|77|7|
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
Psa|77|8|
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
Psa|77|9|
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
Psa|77|10|
And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
Psa|77|11|
I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
Psa|77|12|
I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Psa|77|13|
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
Psa|77|14|
Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
Psa|77|15|
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
Psa|77|16|
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
Psa|77|17|
The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
Psa|77|18|
The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
Psa|77|19|
Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Psa|77|20|
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psa|78|1|
Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psa|78|2|
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
Psa|78|3|
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
Psa|78|4|
We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
Psa|78|5|
For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
Psa|78|6|
That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
Psa|78|7|
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
Psa|78|8|
And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
Psa|78|9|
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
Psa|78|10|
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
Psa|78|11|
And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Psa|78|12|
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
Psa|78|13|
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
Psa|78|14|
In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
Psa|78|15|
He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
Psa|78|16|
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psa|78|17|
And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
Psa|78|18|
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Psa|78|19|
Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Psa|78|20|
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
Psa|78|21|
Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Psa|78|22|
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Psa|78|23|
Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
Psa|78|24|
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Psa|78|25|
Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psa|78|26|
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
Psa|78|27|
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
Psa|78|28|
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
Psa|78|29|
So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
Psa|78|30|
They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
Psa|78|31|
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
Psa|78|32|
For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Psa|78|33|
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
Psa|78|34|
When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
Psa|78|35|
And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Psa|78|36|
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
Psa|78|37|
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
Psa|78|38|
But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
Psa|78|39|
For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psa|78|40|
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
Psa|78|41|
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
Psa|78|42|
They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
Psa|78|43|
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
Psa|78|44|
And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
Psa|78|45|
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psa|78|46|
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
Psa|78|47|
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
Psa|78|48|
He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psa|78|49|
He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
Psa|78|50|
He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
Psa|78|51|
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
Psa|78|52|
But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psa|78|53|
And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psa|78|54|
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
Psa|78|55|
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psa|78|56|
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
Psa|78|57|
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psa|78|58|
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psa|78|59|
When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psa|78|60|
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
Psa|78|61|
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
Psa|78|62|
He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
Psa|78|63|
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Psa|78|64|
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Psa|78|65|
Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psa|78|66|
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psa|78|67|
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
Psa|78|68|
But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psa|78|69|
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psa|78|70|
He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
Psa|78|71|
From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psa|78|72|
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
