Psa|59|1|
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
Psa|59|2|
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
Psa|59|3|
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
Psa|59|4|
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.
Psa|59|5|
Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.
Psa|59|6|
They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Psa|59|7|
Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
Psa|59|8|
But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
Psa|59|9|
Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.
Psa|59|10|
The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
Psa|59|11|
Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
Psa|59|12|
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.
Psa|59|13|
Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
Psa|59|14|
And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Psa|59|15|
Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
Psa|59|16|
But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
Psa|59|17|
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
Psa|60|1|
O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
Psa|60|2|
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
Psa|60|3|
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
Psa|60|4|
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
Psa|60|5|
That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
Psa|60|6|
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Psa|60|7|
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Psa|60|8|
Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
Psa|60|9|
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Psa|60|10|
Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?
Psa|60|11|
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Psa|60|12|
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
Psa|61|1|
Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
Psa|61|2|
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
Psa|61|3|
For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
Psa|61|4|
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
Psa|61|5|
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
Psa|61|6|
Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.
Psa|61|7|
He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
Psa|61|8|
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
