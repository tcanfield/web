Hos|5|1|
Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
Hos|5|2|
And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.
Hos|5|3|
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.
Hos|5|4|
They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.
Hos|5|5|
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.
Hos|5|6|
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.
Hos|5|7|
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
Hos|5|8|
Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.
Hos|5|9|
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
Hos|5|10|
The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hos|5|11|
Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
Hos|5|12|
Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
Hos|5|13|
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
Hos|5|14|
For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.
Hos|5|15|
I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.
Hos|6|1|
Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
Hos|6|2|
After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
Hos|6|3|
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.
Hos|6|4|
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
Hos|6|5|
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
Hos|6|6|
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
Hos|6|7|
But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Hos|6|8|
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.
Hos|6|9|
And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.
Hos|6|10|
I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
Hos|6|11|
Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
Hos|7|1|
When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.
Hos|7|2|
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
Hos|7|3|
They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
Hos|7|4|
They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
Hos|7|5|
In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
Hos|7|6|
For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
Hos|7|7|
They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
Hos|7|8|
Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Hos|7|9|
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.
Hos|7|10|
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.
Hos|7|11|
Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
Hos|7|12|
When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
Hos|7|13|
Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
Hos|7|14|
And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.
Hos|7|15|
Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
Hos|7|16|
They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
