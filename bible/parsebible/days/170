Psa|82|1|
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
Psa|82|2|
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Psa|82|3|
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Psa|82|4|
Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psa|82|5|
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
Psa|82|6|
I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
Psa|82|7|
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Psa|82|8|
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
Psa|83|1|
Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
Psa|83|2|
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Psa|83|3|
They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
Psa|83|4|
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Psa|83|5|
For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
Psa|83|6|
The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Psa|83|7|
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Psa|83|8|
Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
Psa|83|9|
Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
Psa|83|10|
Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
Psa|83|11|
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
Psa|83|12|
Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
Psa|83|13|
O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
Psa|83|14|
As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
Psa|83|15|
So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
Psa|83|16|
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Psa|83|17|
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
Psa|83|18|
That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
Psa|84|1|
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
Psa|84|2|
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
Psa|84|3|
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
Psa|84|4|
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
Psa|84|5|
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
Psa|84|6|
Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
Psa|84|7|
They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
Psa|84|8|
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Psa|84|9|
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
Psa|84|10|
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
Psa|84|11|
For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
Psa|84|12|
O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
