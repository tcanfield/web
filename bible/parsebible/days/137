Job|15|1|
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job|15|2|
Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
Job|15|3|
Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
Job|15|4|
Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
Job|15|5|
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
Job|15|6|
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
Job|15|7|
Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
Job|15|8|
Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
Job|15|9|
What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?
Job|15|10|
With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
Job|15|11|
Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
Job|15|12|
Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
Job|15|13|
That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
Job|15|14|
What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
Job|15|15|
Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
Job|15|16|
How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
Job|15|17|
I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;
Job|15|18|
Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
Job|15|19|
Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
Job|15|20|
The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
Job|15|21|
A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
Job|15|22|
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
Job|15|23|
He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
Job|15|24|
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
Job|15|25|
For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
Job|15|26|
He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
Job|15|27|
Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.
Job|15|28|
And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
Job|15|29|
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
Job|15|30|
He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
Job|15|31|
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
Job|15|32|
It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
Job|15|33|
He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
Job|15|34|
For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
Job|15|35|
They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
Job|16|1|
Then Job answered and said,
Job|16|2|
I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
Job|16|3|
Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
Job|16|4|
I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
Job|16|5|
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
Job|16|6|
Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
Job|16|7|
But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
Job|16|8|
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
Job|16|9|
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
Job|16|10|
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
Job|16|11|
God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
Job|16|12|
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
Job|16|13|
His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
Job|16|14|
He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
Job|16|15|
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
Job|16|16|
My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
Job|16|17|
Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
Job|16|18|
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
Job|16|19|
Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
Job|16|20|
My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
Job|16|21|
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
Job|16|22|
When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
Job|17|1|
My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
Job|17|2|
Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
Job|17|3|
Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
Job|17|4|
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
Job|17|5|
He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
Job|17|6|
He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
Job|17|7|
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
Job|17|8|
Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
Job|17|9|
The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
Job|17|10|
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
Job|17|11|
My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.
Job|17|12|
They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
Job|17|13|
If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
Job|17|14|
I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
Job|17|15|
And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
Job|17|16|
They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
Job|18|1|
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|18|2|
How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
Job|18|3|
Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
Job|18|4|
He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
Job|18|5|
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
Job|18|6|
The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
Job|18|7|
The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
Job|18|8|
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
Job|18|9|
The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
Job|18|10|
The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
Job|18|11|
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
Job|18|12|
His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
Job|18|13|
It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
Job|18|14|
His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
Job|18|15|
It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
Job|18|16|
His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
Job|18|17|
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
Job|18|18|
He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
Job|18|19|
He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
Job|18|20|
They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
Job|18|21|
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
