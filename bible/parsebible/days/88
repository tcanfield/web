Sa2|23|1|
Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
Sa2|23|2|
The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.
Sa2|23|3|
The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
Sa2|23|4|
And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
Sa2|23|5|
Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
Sa2|23|6|
But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
Sa2|23|7|
But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.
Sa2|23|8|
These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
Sa2|23|9|
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
Sa2|23|10|
He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
Sa2|23|11|
And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
Sa2|23|12|
But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.
Sa2|23|13|
And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
Sa2|23|14|
And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
Sa2|23|15|
And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
Sa2|23|16|
And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
Sa2|23|17|
And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
Sa2|23|18|
And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
Sa2|23|19|
Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
Sa2|23|20|
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
Sa2|23|21|
And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
Sa2|23|22|
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
Sa2|23|23|
He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
Sa2|23|24|
Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
Sa2|23|25|
Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
Sa2|23|26|
Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
Sa2|23|27|
Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
Sa2|23|28|
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
Sa2|23|29|
Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
Sa2|23|30|
Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
Sa2|23|31|
Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
Sa2|23|32|
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
Sa2|23|33|
Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
Sa2|23|34|
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
Sa2|23|35|
Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
Sa2|23|36|
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
Sa2|23|37|
Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
Sa2|23|38|
Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,
Sa2|23|39|
Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
Sa2|24|1|
And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
Sa2|24|2|
For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
Sa2|24|3|
And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
Sa2|24|4|
Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
Sa2|24|5|
And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
Sa2|24|6|
Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,
Sa2|24|7|
And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.
Sa2|24|8|
So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
Sa2|24|9|
And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
Sa2|24|10|
And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
Sa2|24|11|
For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
Sa2|24|12|
Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
Sa2|24|13|
So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
Sa2|24|14|
And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
Sa2|24|15|
So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
Sa2|24|16|
And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
Sa2|24|17|
And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
Sa2|24|18|
And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.
Sa2|24|19|
And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
Sa2|24|20|
And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
Sa2|24|21|
And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
Sa2|24|22|
And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
Sa2|24|23|
All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
Sa2|24|24|
And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
Sa2|24|25|
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
Kg1|1|1|
Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
Kg1|1|2|
Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
Kg1|1|3|
So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
Kg1|1|4|
And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
Kg1|1|5|
Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
Kg1|1|6|
And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
Kg1|1|7|
And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
Kg1|1|8|
But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
Kg1|1|9|
And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
Kg1|1|10|
But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
Kg1|1|11|
Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
Kg1|1|12|
Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
Kg1|1|13|
Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
Kg1|1|14|
Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
Kg1|1|15|
And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
Kg1|1|16|
And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
Kg1|1|17|
And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
Kg1|1|18|
And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:
Kg1|1|19|
And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
Kg1|1|20|
And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
Kg1|1|21|
Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
Kg1|1|22|
And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
Kg1|1|23|
And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
Kg1|1|24|
And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
Kg1|1|25|
For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
Kg1|1|26|
But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
Kg1|1|27|
Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
Kg1|1|28|
Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
Kg1|1|29|
And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
Kg1|1|30|
Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
Kg1|1|31|
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
Kg1|1|32|
And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
Kg1|1|33|
The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
Kg1|1|34|
And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
Kg1|1|35|
Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
Kg1|1|36|
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
Kg1|1|37|
As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
Kg1|1|38|
So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
Kg1|1|39|
And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
Kg1|1|40|
And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
Kg1|1|41|
And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
Kg1|1|42|
And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
Kg1|1|43|
And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
Kg1|1|44|
And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
Kg1|1|45|
And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
Kg1|1|46|
And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
Kg1|1|47|
And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
Kg1|1|48|
And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
Kg1|1|49|
And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
Kg1|1|50|
And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
Kg1|1|51|
And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
Kg1|1|52|
And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
Kg1|1|53|
So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.
