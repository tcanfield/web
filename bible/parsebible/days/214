Isa|25|2|
For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
Isa|25|3|
Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
Isa|25|4|
For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
Isa|25|11|
And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
Isa|25|12|
And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

Isa|26|9|
With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
Isa|26|10|
Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
Isa|26|11|
LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
Isa|26|12|
LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
Isa|26|13|
O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
Isa|26|14|
They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
