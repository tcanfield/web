Jo3|1|1|
The elder unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
Jo3|1|2|
Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
Jo3|1|3|
For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
Jo3|1|4|
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
Jo3|1|5|
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
Jo3|1|6|
Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:
Jo3|1|7|
Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
Jo3|1|8|
We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
Jo3|1|9|
I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
Jo3|1|10|
Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.
Jo3|1|11|
Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
Jo3|1|12|
Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
Jo3|1|13|
I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
Jo3|1|14|
But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
Jde|1|1|
Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:
Jde|1|2|
Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
Jde|1|3|
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
Jde|1|4|
For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
Jde|1|5|
I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
Jde|1|6|
And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Jde|1|7|
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
Jde|1|8|
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
Jde|1|9|
Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
Jde|1|10|
But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
Jde|1|11|
Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
Jde|1|12|
These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
Jde|1|13|
Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
Jde|1|14|
And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
Jde|1|15|
To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
Jde|1|16|
These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.
Jde|1|17|
But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Jde|1|18|
How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.
Jde|1|19|
These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
Jde|1|20|
But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
Jde|1|21|
Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jde|1|22|
And of some have compassion, making a difference:
Jde|1|23|
And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
Jde|1|24|
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
Jde|1|25|
To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
Rev|1|1|
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:
Rev|1|2|
Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
Rev|1|3|
Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.
Rev|1|4|
John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
Rev|1|5|
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
Rev|1|6|
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
Rev|1|7|
Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
Rev|1|8|
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
Rev|1|9|
I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
Rev|1|10|
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
Rev|1|11|
Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
Rev|1|12|
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
Rev|1|13|
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
Rev|1|14|
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
Rev|1|15|
And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
Rev|1|16|
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
Rev|1|17|
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
Rev|1|18|
I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
Rev|1|19|
Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
Rev|1|20|
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
