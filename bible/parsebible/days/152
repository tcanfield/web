Psa|24|1|
The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Psa|24|2|
For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
Psa|24|3|
Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?
Psa|24|4|
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
Psa|24|5|
He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
Psa|24|6|
This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
Psa|24|7|

Psa|24|8|
Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
Psa|24|9|
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
Psa|24|10|
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
Psa|25|1|
Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
Psa|25|2|
O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
Psa|25|3|
Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
Psa|25|4|
Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
Psa|25|5|
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
Psa|25|6|
Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.
Psa|25|7|
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
Psa|25|8|
Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Psa|25|9|
The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
Psa|25|10|
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
Psa|25|11|
For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.
Psa|25|12|
What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
Psa|25|13|
His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
Psa|25|14|
The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.
Psa|25|15|
Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
Psa|25|16|
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
Psa|25|17|
The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
Psa|25|18|
Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
Psa|25|19|
Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
Psa|25|20|
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
Psa|25|21|
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
Psa|25|22|
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
Psa|26|1|
Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
Psa|26|2|
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
Psa|26|3|
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
Psa|26|4|
I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
Psa|26|5|
I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
Psa|26|6|
I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:
Psa|26|7|
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Psa|26|8|
LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
Psa|26|9|
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
Psa|26|10|
In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
Psa|26|11|
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
Psa|26|12|
My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
