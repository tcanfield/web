Act|14|1|
And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
Act|14|2|
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.
Act|14|3|
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
Act|14|4|
But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
Act|14|5|
And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,
Act|14|6|
They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:
Act|14|7|
And there they preached the gospel.
Act|14|8|
And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:
Act|14|9|
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
Act|14|10|
Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
Act|14|11|
And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
Act|14|12|
And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
Act|14|13|
Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
Act|14|14|
Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
Act|14|15|
And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:
Act|14|16|
Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
Act|14|17|
Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
Act|14|18|
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
Act|14|19|
And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.
Act|14|20|
Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
Act|14|21|
And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
Act|14|22|
Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
Act|14|23|
And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
Act|14|24|
And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
Act|14|25|
And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
Act|14|26|
And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
Act|14|27|
And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
Act|14|28|
And there they abode long time with the disciples.
Act|15|1|
And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
Act|15|2|
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
Act|15|3|
And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
Act|15|4|
And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
Act|15|5|
But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
Act|15|6|
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
Act|15|7|
And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
Act|15|8|
And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;
Act|15|9|
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
Act|15|10|
Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
Act|15|11|
But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
Act|15|12|
Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
Act|15|13|
And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:
Act|15|14|
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
Act|15|15|
And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
Act|15|16|
After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
Act|15|17|
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
Act|15|18|
Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
Act|15|19|
Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
Act|15|20|
But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
Act|15|21|
For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
Act|15|22|
Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
Act|15|23|
And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.
Act|15|24|
Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
Act|15|25|
It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Act|15|26|
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Act|15|27|
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.
Act|15|28|
For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
Act|15|29|
That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
Act|15|30|
So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:
Act|15|31|
Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
Act|15|32|
And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.
Act|15|33|
And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.
Act|15|34|
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
Act|15|35|
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
Act|15|36|
And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.
Act|15|37|
And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
Act|15|38|
But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
Act|15|39|
And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;
Act|15|40|
And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.
Act|15|41|
And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
Act|16|1|
Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:
Act|16|2|
Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Act|16|3|
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.
Act|16|4|
And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.
Act|16|5|
And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
Act|16|6|
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
Act|16|7|
After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.
Act|16|8|
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
Act|16|9|
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
Act|16|10|
And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.
Act|16|11|
Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
Act|16|12|
And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
Act|16|13|
And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.
Act|16|14|
And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
Act|16|15|
And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.
Act|16|16|
And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
Act|16|17|
The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
Act|16|18|
And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
Act|16|19|
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,
Act|16|20|
And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
Act|16|21|
And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
Act|16|22|
And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.
Act|16|23|
And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
Act|16|24|
Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
Act|16|25|
And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.
Act|16|26|
And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
Act|16|27|
And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
Act|16|28|
But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
Act|16|29|
Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
Act|16|30|
And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Act|16|31|
And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
Act|16|32|
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
Act|16|33|
And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
Act|16|34|
And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
Act|16|35|
And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
Act|16|36|
And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.
Act|16|37|
But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
Act|16|38|
And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.
Act|16|39|
And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.
Act|16|40|
And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
Act|17|1|
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
Act|17|2|
And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
Act|17|3|
Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.
Act|17|4|
And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
Act|17|5|
But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
Act|17|6|
And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
Act|17|7|
Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.
Act|17|8|
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
Act|17|9|
And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
Act|17|10|
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Act|17|11|
These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
Act|17|12|
Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
Act|17|13|
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
Act|17|14|
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
Act|17|15|
And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
Act|17|16|
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
Act|17|17|
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
Act|17|18|
Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
Act|17|19|
And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?
Act|17|20|
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Act|17|21|
(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
Act|17|22|
Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
Act|17|23|
For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
Act|17|24|
God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
Act|17|25|
Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
Act|17|26|
And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
Act|17|27|
That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
Act|17|28|
For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
Act|17|29|
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.
Act|17|30|
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
Act|17|31|
Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
Act|17|32|
And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.
Act|17|33|
So Paul departed from among them.
Act|17|34|
Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
