Psa|6|1|
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psa|6|2|
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
Psa|6|3|
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
Psa|6|4|
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
Psa|6|5|
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
Psa|6|6|
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Psa|6|7|
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Psa|6|8|
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
Psa|6|9|
The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
Psa|6|10|
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
Psa|7|1|
O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
Psa|7|2|
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
Psa|7|3|
O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
Psa|7|4|
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
Psa|7|5|
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
Psa|7|6|
Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
Psa|7|7|
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
Psa|7|8|
The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
Psa|7|9|
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
Psa|7|10|
My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
Psa|7|11|
God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
Psa|7|12|
If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
Psa|7|13|
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
Psa|7|14|
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
Psa|7|15|
He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
Psa|7|16|
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
Psa|7|17|
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
Psa|8|1|
O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
Psa|8|2|
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
Psa|8|3|
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
Psa|8|4|
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Psa|8|5|
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
Psa|8|6|
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
Psa|8|7|
All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
Psa|8|8|
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
Psa|8|9|
O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
Psa|9|1|
I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
Psa|9|2|
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
Psa|9|3|
When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
Psa|9|4|
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
Psa|9|5|
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
Psa|9|6|
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
Psa|9|7|
But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
Psa|9|8|
And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
Psa|9|9|
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
Psa|9|10|
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
Psa|9|11|
Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
Psa|9|12|
When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
Psa|9|13|
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
Psa|9|14|
That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
Psa|9|15|
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
Psa|9|16|
The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
Psa|9|17|
The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
Psa|9|18|
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
Psa|9|19|
Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
Psa|9|20|
Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.
