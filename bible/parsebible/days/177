Psa|106|1|
Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa|106|2|
Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?
Psa|106|3|
Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Psa|106|4|
Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
Psa|106|5|
That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
Psa|106|6|
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psa|106|7|
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
Psa|106|8|
Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psa|106|9|
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
Psa|106|10|
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psa|106|11|
And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
Psa|106|12|
Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
Psa|106|13|
They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
Psa|106|14|
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
Psa|106|15|
And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
Psa|106|16|
They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
Psa|106|17|
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
Psa|106|18|
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
Psa|106|19|
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
Psa|106|20|
Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
Psa|106|21|
They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
Psa|106|22|
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
Psa|106|23|
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
Psa|106|24|
Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
Psa|106|25|
But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
Psa|106|26|
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
Psa|106|27|
To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
Psa|106|28|
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psa|106|29|
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
Psa|106|30|
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
Psa|106|31|
And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
Psa|106|32|
They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
Psa|106|33|
Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psa|106|34|
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
Psa|106|35|
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
Psa|106|36|
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Psa|106|37|
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
Psa|106|38|
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
Psa|106|39|
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
Psa|106|40|
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
Psa|106|41|
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Psa|106|42|
Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psa|106|43|
Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Psa|106|44|
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
Psa|106|45|
And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
Psa|106|46|
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
Psa|106|47|
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
Psa|106|48|
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa|107|1|
O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa|107|2|
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
Psa|107|3|
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
Psa|107|4|
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
Psa|107|5|
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Psa|107|6|
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
Psa|107|7|
And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Psa|107|8|
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa|107|9|
For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Psa|107|10|
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;
Psa|107|11|
Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
Psa|107|12|
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
Psa|107|13|
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
Psa|107|14|
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
Psa|107|15|
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa|107|16|
For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
Psa|107|17|
Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Psa|107|18|
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
Psa|107|19|
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.
Psa|107|20|
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
Psa|107|21|
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa|107|22|
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
Psa|107|23|
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
Psa|107|24|
These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
Psa|107|25|
For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
Psa|107|26|
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
Psa|107|27|
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
Psa|107|28|
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
Psa|107|29|
He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
Psa|107|30|
Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Psa|107|31|
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa|107|32|
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
Psa|107|33|
He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
Psa|107|34|
A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Psa|107|35|
He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
Psa|107|36|
And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
Psa|107|37|
And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
Psa|107|38|
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Psa|107|39|
Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
Psa|107|40|
He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
Psa|107|41|
Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
Psa|107|42|
The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Psa|107|43|
Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
Psa|108|1|
O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Psa|108|2|
Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
Psa|108|3|
I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
Psa|108|4|
For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
Psa|108|5|
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
Psa|108|6|
That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
Psa|108|7|
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Psa|108|8|
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Psa|108|9|
Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
Psa|108|10|
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Psa|108|11|
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Psa|108|12|
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Psa|108|13|
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
