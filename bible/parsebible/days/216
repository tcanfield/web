Isa|31|4|
For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.

Isa|32|1|
Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.

The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
Isa|32|5|
The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.
Isa|32|6|

Isa|32|14|
Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
Isa|32|15|
Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
Isa|32|16|
Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
Isa|32|17|
And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
Isa|32|18|

Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.
Isa|33|11|
Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.
Isa|33|12|

Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?
