Psa|13|1|
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
Psa|13|2|
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Psa|13|3|
Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
Psa|13|4|
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
Psa|13|5|
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
Psa|13|6|
I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
Psa|14|1|
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
Psa|14|2|
The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.
Psa|14|3|
They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Psa|14|4|
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
Psa|14|5|
There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.
Psa|14|6|
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.
Psa|14|7|
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
Psa|15|1|
Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
Psa|15|2|
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
Psa|15|3|
He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
Psa|15|4|
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
Psa|15|5|
He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
Psa|16|1|
Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
Psa|16|2|
O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;
Psa|16|3|
But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
Psa|16|4|
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
Psa|16|5|
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
Psa|16|6|
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
Psa|16|7|
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
Psa|16|8|
I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Psa|16|9|
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
Psa|16|10|
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Psa|16|11|
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
