Hos|11|1|
When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
Hos|11|2|
As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.
Hos|11|3|
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
Hos|11|4|
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.
Hos|11|5|
He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.
Hos|11|6|
And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.
Hos|11|7|
And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.
Hos|11|8|
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel?  how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
Hos|11|9|
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.
Hos|11|10|
They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.
Hos|11|11|
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.
Hos|11|12|
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
Hos|12|1|
Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.
Hos|12|2|
The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.
Hos|12|3|
He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:
Hos|12|4|
Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;
Hos|12|5|
Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.
Hos|12|6|
Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continually.
Hos|12|7|
He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.
Hos|12|8|
And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.
Hos|12|9|
And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.
Hos|12|10|
I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
Hos|12|11|
Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
Hos|12|12|
And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
Hos|12|13|
And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
Hos|12|14|
Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto him.
Hos|13|1|
When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
Hos|13|2|
And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
Hos|13|3|
Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
Hos|13|4|
Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.
Hos|13|5|
I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
Hos|13|6|
According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.
Hos|13|7|
Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:
Hos|13|8|
I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.
Hos|13|9|
O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.
Hos|13|10|
I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
Hos|13|11|
I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.
Hos|13|12|
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
Hos|13|13|
The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.
Hos|13|14|
I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
Hos|13|15|
Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.
Hos|13|16|
Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
