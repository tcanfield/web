Psa|55|1|
Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
Psa|55|2|
Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
Psa|55|3|
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
Psa|55|4|
My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

Psa|55|15|
