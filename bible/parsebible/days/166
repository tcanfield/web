Psa|69|1|
Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
Psa|69|2|
I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
Psa|69|3|
I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
Psa|69|4|
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
Psa|69|5|
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
Psa|69|6|
Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
Psa|69|7|
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
Psa|69|8|
I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.
Psa|69|9|
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
Psa|69|10|
When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
Psa|69|11|
I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
Psa|69|12|
They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
Psa|69|13|
But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
Psa|69|14|
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Psa|69|15|
Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Psa|69|16|
Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
Psa|69|17|
And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
Psa|69|18|
Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
Psa|69|19|
Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
Psa|69|20|
Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
Psa|69|21|
They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Psa|69|22|
Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
Psa|69|23|
Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
Psa|69|24|
Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
Psa|69|25|
Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
Psa|69|26|
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
Psa|69|27|
Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
Psa|69|28|
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
Psa|69|29|
But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
Psa|69|30|
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
Psa|69|31|
This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
Psa|69|32|
The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
Psa|69|33|
For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
Psa|69|34|
Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
Psa|69|35|
For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
Psa|69|36|
The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
Psa|70|1|
MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.
Psa|70|2|
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
Psa|70|3|
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
Psa|70|4|
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
Psa|70|5|
But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
Psa|71|1|
In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.
Psa|71|2|
Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
Psa|71|3|
Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.
Psa|71|4|
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
Psa|71|5|
For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.
Psa|71|6|
By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.
Psa|71|7|
I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
Psa|71|8|
Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.
Psa|71|9|
Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
Psa|71|10|
For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
Psa|71|11|
Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
Psa|71|12|
O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
Psa|71|13|
Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
Psa|71|14|
But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
Psa|71|15|
My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
Psa|71|16|
I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
Psa|71|17|
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
Psa|71|18|
Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
Psa|71|19|
Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!
Psa|71|20|
Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
Psa|71|21|
Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
Psa|71|22|
I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
Psa|71|23|
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
Psa|71|24|
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
