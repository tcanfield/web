Psa|17|1|
Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Psa|17|2|
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
Psa|17|3|
Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
Psa|17|4|
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
Psa|17|5|
Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
Psa|17|6|
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
Psa|17|7|
Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.
Psa|17|8|
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
Psa|17|9|
From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
Psa|17|10|
They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
Psa|17|11|
They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
Psa|17|12|
Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Psa|17|13|
Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:
Psa|17|14|
From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
Psa|17|15|
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
Psa|18|1|
I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
Psa|18|2|
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
Psa|18|3|
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
Psa|18|4|
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
Psa|18|5|
The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
Psa|18|6|
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.
Psa|18|7|
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
Psa|18|8|
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
Psa|18|9|
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
Psa|18|10|
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
Psa|18|11|
He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
Psa|18|12|
At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
Psa|18|13|
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.
Psa|18|14|
Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
Psa|18|15|
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
Psa|18|16|
He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
Psa|18|17|
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
Psa|18|18|
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
Psa|18|19|
He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
Psa|18|20|
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
Psa|18|21|
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
Psa|18|22|
For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
Psa|18|23|
I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
Psa|18|24|
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
Psa|18|25|
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
Psa|18|26|
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
Psa|18|27|
For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
Psa|18|28|
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
Psa|18|29|
For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
Psa|18|30|
As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
Psa|18|31|
For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
Psa|18|32|
It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
Psa|18|33|
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
Psa|18|34|
He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
Psa|18|35|
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
Psa|18|36|
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
Psa|18|37|
I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
Psa|18|38|
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
Psa|18|39|
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
Psa|18|40|
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
Psa|18|41|
They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
Psa|18|42|
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
Psa|18|43|
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
Psa|18|44|
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
Psa|18|45|
The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
Psa|18|46|
The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
Psa|18|47|
It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
Psa|18|48|
He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
Psa|18|49|
Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
Psa|18|50|
Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
Psa|19|1|
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
Psa|19|2|
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
Psa|19|3|
There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
Psa|19|4|
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
Psa|19|5|
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
Psa|19|6|
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
Psa|19|7|
The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
Psa|19|8|
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
Psa|19|9|
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
Psa|19|10|
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Psa|19|11|
Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
Psa|19|12|
Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
Psa|19|13|
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
Psa|19|14|
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
Psa|20|1|
The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Psa|20|2|
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Psa|20|3|
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Psa|20|4|
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
Psa|20|5|
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
Psa|20|6|
Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Psa|20|7|
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
Psa|20|8|
They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Psa|20|9|
Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
