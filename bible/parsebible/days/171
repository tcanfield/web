Psa|85|1|
Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
Psa|85|2|
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
Psa|85|3|
Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
Psa|85|4|
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
Psa|85|5|
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
Psa|85|6|
Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Psa|85|7|
Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
Psa|85|8|
I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
Psa|85|9|
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
Psa|85|10|
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Psa|85|11|
Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
Psa|85|12|
Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.
Psa|85|13|
Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
Psa|86|1|
Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
Psa|86|2|
Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
Psa|86|3|
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
Psa|86|4|
Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
Psa|86|5|
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
Psa|86|6|
Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
Psa|86|7|
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
Psa|86|8|
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
Psa|86|9|
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
Psa|86|10|
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Psa|86|11|
Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
Psa|86|12|
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
Psa|86|13|
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
Psa|86|14|
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
Psa|86|15|
But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
Psa|86|16|
O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
Psa|86|17|
Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
Psa|87|1|
His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Psa|87|2|
The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Psa|87|3|
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
Psa|87|4|
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
Psa|87|5|
And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.
Psa|87|6|
The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.
Psa|87|7|
As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.
Psa|88|1|
O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
Psa|88|2|
Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
Psa|88|3|
For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
Psa|88|4|
I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:
Psa|88|5|
Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
Psa|88|6|
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
Psa|88|7|
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
Psa|88|8|
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
Psa|88|9|
Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
Psa|88|10|
Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
Psa|88|11|
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?
Psa|88|12|
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
Psa|88|13|
But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
Psa|88|14|
LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?
Psa|88|15|
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
Psa|88|16|
Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
Psa|88|17|
They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
Psa|88|18|
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
