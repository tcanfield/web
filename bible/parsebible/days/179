Psa|113|1|
Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.
Psa|113|2|
Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
Psa|113|3|
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.
Psa|113|4|
The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
Psa|113|5|
Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
Psa|113|6|
Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
Psa|113|7|
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
Psa|113|8|
That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
Psa|113|9|
He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa|114|1|
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Psa|114|2|
Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
Psa|114|3|
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
Psa|114|4|
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
Psa|114|5|
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
Psa|114|6|
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
Psa|114|7|
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
Psa|114|8|
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
Psa|115|1|
Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
Psa|115|2|
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
Psa|115|3|
But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
Psa|115|4|
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa|115|5|
They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
Psa|115|6|
They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
Psa|115|7|
They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
Psa|115|8|
They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
Psa|115|9|
O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa|115|10|
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa|115|11|
Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa|115|12|
The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
Psa|115|13|
He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
Psa|115|14|
The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Psa|115|15|
Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
Psa|115|16|
The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
Psa|115|17|
The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
Psa|115|18|
But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
