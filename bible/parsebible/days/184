Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
Psa|129|2|
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.

The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
Psa|129|4|
The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Psa|129|5|
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
Psa|129|6|
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
Psa|129|7|
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
Psa|129|8|
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
Psa|130|1|
Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
Psa|130|2|
Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Psa|130|3|
If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
Psa|130|4|

Psa|130|5|
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.

Psa|130|7|
Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
Psa|130|8|
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
Psa|131|1|
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
Psa|131|2|
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
Psa|131|3|
Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
