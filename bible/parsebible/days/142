Job|32|1|
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Job|32|2|
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Job|32|3|
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Job|32|4|
Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
Job|32|5|
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
Job|32|6|
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
Job|32|7|
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
Job|32|8|
But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job|32|9|
Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job|32|10|
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
Job|32|11|
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
Job|32|12|
Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
Job|32|13|
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
Job|32|14|
Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job|32|15|
They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
Job|32|16|
When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
Job|32|17|
I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
Job|32|18|
For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
Job|32|19|
Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
Job|32|20|
I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
Job|32|21|
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
Job|32|22|
For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
Job|33|1|
Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
Job|33|2|
Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
Job|33|3|
My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
Job|33|4|
The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
Job|33|5|
If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
Job|33|6|
Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
Job|33|7|
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
Job|33|8|
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
Job|33|9|
I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
Job|33|10|
Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
Job|33|11|
He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
Job|33|12|
Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
Job|33|13|
Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
Job|33|14|
For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
Job|33|15|
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
Job|33|16|
Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
Job|33|17|
That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
Job|33|18|
He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
Job|33|19|
He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
Job|33|20|
So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
Job|33|21|
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
Job|33|22|
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
Job|33|23|
If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
Job|33|24|
Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
Job|33|25|
His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
Job|33|26|
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
Job|33|27|
He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
Job|33|28|
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
Job|33|29|
Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
Job|33|30|
To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
Job|33|31|
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
Job|33|32|
If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
Job|33|33|
If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
Job|34|1|
Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
Job|34|2|
Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
Job|34|3|
For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
Job|34|4|
Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job|34|5|
For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
Job|34|6|
Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
Job|34|7|
What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
Job|34|8|
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
Job|34|9|
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
Job|34|10|
Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
Job|34|11|
For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
Job|34|12|
Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
Job|34|13|
Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job|34|14|
If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
Job|34|15|
All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
Job|34|16|
If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
Job|34|17|
Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
Job|34|18|
Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
Job|34|19|
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
Job|34|20|
In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
Job|34|21|
For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
Job|34|22|
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job|34|23|
For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
Job|34|24|
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
Job|34|25|
Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
Job|34|26|
He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job|34|27|
Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
Job|34|28|
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
Job|34|29|
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
Job|34|30|
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
Job|34|31|
Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
Job|34|32|
That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
Job|34|33|
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
Job|34|34|
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
Job|34|35|
Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
Job|34|36|
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
Job|34|37|
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
