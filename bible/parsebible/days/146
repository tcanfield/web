I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
Psa|3|5|
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
Psa|3|6|
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
Psa|3|7|
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Psa|3|8|
Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
Psa|4|1|
Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
Psa|4|2|
O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
Psa|4|3|

Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
Psa|5|2|
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
Psa|5|3|
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
Psa|5|4|
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
Psa|5|5|
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Psa|5|6|
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
Psa|5|7|
But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Psa|5|8|
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
Psa|5|9|
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Psa|5|10|
Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
Psa|5|11|
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
Psa|5|12|
For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
