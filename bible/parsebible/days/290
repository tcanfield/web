Mat|20|1|
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
Mat|20|2|
And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Mat|20|3|
And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
Mat|20|4|
And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
Mat|20|5|
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
Mat|20|6|
And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
Mat|20|7|
They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.
Mat|20|8|
So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
Mat|20|9|
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
Mat|20|10|
But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
Mat|20|11|
And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
Mat|20|12|
Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
Mat|20|13|
But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
Mat|20|14|
Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
Mat|20|15|
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
Mat|20|16|
So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
Mat|20|17|
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
Mat|20|18|
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
Mat|20|19|
And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.
Mat|20|20|
Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
Mat|20|21|
And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
Mat|20|22|
But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.
Mat|20|23|
And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
Mat|20|24|
And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
Mat|20|25|
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
Mat|20|26|
But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
Mat|20|27|
And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
Mat|20|28|
Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Mat|20|29|
And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
Mat|20|30|
And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
Mat|20|31|
And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
Mat|20|32|
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
Mat|20|33|
They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Mat|20|34|
So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
Mat|21|1|
And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
Mat|21|2|
Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.
Mat|21|3|
And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
Mat|21|4|
All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
Mat|21|5|
Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
Mat|21|6|
And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
Mat|21|7|
And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.
Mat|21|8|
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
Mat|21|9|
And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
Mat|21|10|
And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
Mat|21|11|
And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
Mat|21|12|
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
Mat|21|13|
And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
Mat|21|14|
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
Mat|21|15|
And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
Mat|21|16|
And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
Mat|21|17|
And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
Mat|21|18|
Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
Mat|21|19|
And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
Mat|21|20|
And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
Mat|21|21|
Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
Mat|21|22|
And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
Mat|21|23|
And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
Mat|21|24|
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mat|21|25|
The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
Mat|21|26|
But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
Mat|21|27|
And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Mat|21|28|
But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
Mat|21|29|
He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
Mat|21|30|
And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.
Mat|21|31|
Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
Mat|21|32|
For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
Mat|21|33|
Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
Mat|21|34|
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
Mat|21|35|
And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Mat|21|36|
Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
Mat|21|37|
But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
Mat|21|38|
But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
Mat|21|39|
And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
Mat|21|40|
When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
Mat|21|41|
They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
Mat|21|42|
Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
Mat|21|43|
Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
Mat|21|44|
And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
Mat|21|45|
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
Mat|21|46|
But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
Mat|22|1|
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
Mat|22|2|
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
Mat|22|3|
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
Mat|22|4|
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.
Mat|22|5|
But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
Mat|22|6|
And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
Mat|22|7|
But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Mat|22|8|
Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
Mat|22|9|
Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
Mat|22|10|
So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
Mat|22|11|
And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
Mat|22|12|
And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
Mat|22|13|
Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Mat|22|14|
For many are called, but few are chosen.
Mat|22|15|
Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
Mat|22|16|
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
Mat|22|17|
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Mat|22|18|
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
Mat|22|19|
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
Mat|22|20|
And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
Mat|22|21|
They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.
Mat|22|22|
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
Mat|22|23|
The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
Mat|22|24|
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Mat|22|25|
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
Mat|22|26|
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
Mat|22|27|
And last of all the woman died also.
Mat|22|28|
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?  for they all had her.
Mat|22|29|
Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
Mat|22|30|
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
Mat|22|31|
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
Mat|22|32|
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
Mat|22|33|
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
Mat|22|34|
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
Mat|22|35|
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
Mat|22|36|
Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
Mat|22|37|
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
Mat|22|38|
This is the first and great commandment.
Mat|22|39|
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Mat|22|40|
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
Mat|22|41|
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Mat|22|42|
Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.
Mat|22|43|
He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
Mat|22|44|
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
Mat|22|45|
If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
Mat|22|46|
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
