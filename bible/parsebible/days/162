My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Psa|57|5|
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
Psa|57|6|
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.

Psa|57|8|

Psa|58|7|
Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
Psa|58|8|
As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
Psa|58|9|

Psa|58|11|
