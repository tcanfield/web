Co1|11|1|
Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
Co1|11|2|
Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
Co1|11|3|
But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
Co1|11|4|
Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
Co1|11|5|
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
Co1|11|6|
For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
Co1|11|7|
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
Co1|11|8|
For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
Co1|11|9|
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
Co1|11|10|
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
Co1|11|11|
Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
Co1|11|12|
For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
Co1|11|13|
Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
Co1|11|14|
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
Co1|11|15|
But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
Co1|11|16|
But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
Co1|11|17|
Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
Co1|11|18|
For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
Co1|11|19|
For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
Co1|11|20|
When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
Co1|11|21|
For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
Co1|11|22|
What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
Co1|11|23|
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
Co1|11|24|
And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Co1|11|25|
After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
Co1|11|26|
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
Co1|11|27|
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
Co1|11|28|
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
Co1|11|29|
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
Co1|11|30|
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
Co1|11|31|
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
Co1|11|32|
But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
Co1|11|33|
Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
Co1|11|34|
And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
Co1|12|1|
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
Co1|12|2|
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
Co1|12|3|
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
Co1|12|4|
Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
Co1|12|5|
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
Co1|12|6|
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
Co1|12|7|
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
Co1|12|8|
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
Co1|12|9|
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
Co1|12|10|
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
Co1|12|11|
But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
Co1|12|12|
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
Co1|12|13|
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
Co1|12|14|
For the body is not one member, but many.
Co1|12|15|
If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
Co1|12|16|
And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
Co1|12|17|
If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
Co1|12|18|
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
Co1|12|19|
And if they were all one member, where were the body?
Co1|12|20|
But now are they many members, yet but one body.
Co1|12|21|
And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
Co1|12|22|
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
Co1|12|23|
And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
Co1|12|24|
For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.
Co1|12|25|
That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
Co1|12|26|
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
Co1|12|27|
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
Co1|12|28|
And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
Co1|12|29|
Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
Co1|12|30|
Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
Co1|12|31|
But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
Co1|13|1|
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
Co1|13|2|
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
Co1|13|3|
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
Co1|13|4|
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
Co1|13|5|
Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
Co1|13|6|
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
Co1|13|7|
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Co1|13|8|
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
Co1|13|9|
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
Co1|13|10|
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
Co1|13|11|
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
Co1|13|12|
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
Co1|13|13|
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
