Rom|12|1|
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
Rom|12|2|
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
Rom|12|3|
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
Rom|12|4|
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
Rom|12|5|
So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
Rom|12|6|
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
Rom|12|7|
Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
Rom|12|8|
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
Rom|12|9|
Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Rom|12|10|
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
Rom|12|11|
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Rom|12|12|
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
Rom|12|13|
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
Rom|12|14|
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
Rom|12|15|
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
Rom|12|16|
Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
Rom|12|17|
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
Rom|12|18|
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
Rom|12|19|
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
Rom|12|20|
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
Rom|12|21|
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Rom|13|1|
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
Rom|13|2|
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
Rom|13|3|
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
Rom|13|4|
For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
Rom|13|5|
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
Rom|13|6|
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
Rom|13|7|
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
Rom|13|8|
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
Rom|13|9|
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Rom|13|10|
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
Rom|13|11|
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
Rom|13|12|
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
Rom|13|13|
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
Rom|13|14|
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
Rom|14|1|
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
Rom|14|2|
For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
Rom|14|3|
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
Rom|14|4|
Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
Rom|14|5|
One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
Rom|14|6|
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
Rom|14|7|
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
Rom|14|8|
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
Rom|14|9|
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
Rom|14|10|
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
Rom|14|11|
For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
Rom|14|12|
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Rom|14|13|
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.
Rom|14|14|
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
Rom|14|15|
But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
Rom|14|16|
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
Rom|14|17|
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
Rom|14|18|
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
Rom|14|19|
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
Rom|14|20|
For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
Rom|14|21|
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
Rom|14|22|
Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
Rom|14|23|
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
