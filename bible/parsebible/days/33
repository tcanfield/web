Lev|22|1|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|22|2|
Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.
Lev|22|3|
Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
Lev|22|4|
What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
Lev|22|5|
Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
Lev|22|6|
The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
Lev|22|7|
And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.
Lev|22|8|
That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.
Lev|22|9|
They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
Lev|22|10|
There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
Lev|22|11|
But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.
Lev|22|12|
If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
Lev|22|13|
But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof.
Lev|22|14|
And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.
Lev|22|15|
And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;
Lev|22|16|
Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
Lev|22|17|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|22|18|
Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
Lev|22|19|
Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
Lev|22|20|
But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
Lev|22|21|
And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
Lev|22|22|
Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.
Lev|22|23|
Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
Lev|22|24|
Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.
Lev|22|25|
Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
Lev|22|26|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|22|27|
When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Lev|22|28|
And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
Lev|22|29|
And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.
Lev|22|30|
On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.
Lev|22|31|
Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.
Lev|22|32|
Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,
Lev|22|33|
That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.
Lev|23|1|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|23|2|
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.
Lev|23|3|
Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
Lev|23|4|
These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
Lev|23|5|
In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover.
Lev|23|6|
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
Lev|23|7|
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
Lev|23|8|
But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
Lev|23|9|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|23|10|
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
Lev|23|11|
And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Lev|23|12|
And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
Lev|23|13|
And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.
Lev|23|14|
And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Lev|23|15|
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
Lev|23|16|
Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
Lev|23|17|
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.
Lev|23|18|
And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.
Lev|23|19|
Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
Lev|23|20|
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
Lev|23|21|
And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
Lev|23|22|
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
Lev|23|23|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|23|24|
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
Lev|23|25|
Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Lev|23|26|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|23|27|
Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Lev|23|28|
And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
Lev|23|29|
For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
Lev|23|30|
And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
Lev|23|31|
Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Lev|23|32|
It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

Lev|23|37|
These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:
Lev|23|38|
Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.

Lev|23|41|
And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Lev|23|42|
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
Lev|23|43|
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Lev|23|44|
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
Lev|24|1|

Lev|24|2|
Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.
Lev|24|4|
He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
Lev|24|5|
And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
Lev|24|6|
And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
Lev|24|7|
And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Lev|24|8|
Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
Lev|24|9|
And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
Lev|24|10|
And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
Lev|24|11|
And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
Lev|24|12|
And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.
Lev|24|13|
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev|24|14|
Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Lev|24|15|
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
Lev|24|16|
And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.
Lev|24|17|
And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
Lev|24|18|
And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
Lev|24|19|
And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
Lev|24|20|
Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.
Lev|24|21|
And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
Lev|24|22|
Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.
Lev|24|23|
And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev|25|1|
And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Lev|25|2|
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
Lev|25|3|
Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
Lev|25|4|
But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
Lev|25|5|
That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.
Lev|25|6|
And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.
Lev|25|7|
And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
Lev|25|8|
And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
Lev|25|9|
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
Lev|25|10|
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
Lev|25|11|
A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
Lev|25|12|
For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
Lev|25|13|
In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
Lev|25|14|
And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
Lev|25|15|
According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
Lev|25|16|
According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
Lev|25|17|
Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.
Lev|25|18|
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
Lev|25|19|
And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
Lev|25|20|
And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:
Lev|25|21|
Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
Lev|25|22|
And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
Lev|25|23|
The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
Lev|25|24|
And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
Lev|25|25|
If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
Lev|25|26|
And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
Lev|25|27|
Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
Lev|25|28|
But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
Lev|25|29|
And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
Lev|25|30|
And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.
Lev|25|31|
But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.
Lev|25|32|
Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
Lev|25|33|
And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
Lev|25|34|
But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
Lev|25|35|
And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
Lev|25|36|
Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
Lev|25|37|
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
Lev|25|38|
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
Lev|25|39|
And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
Lev|25|40|
But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.
Lev|25|41|
And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
Lev|25|42|
For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Lev|25|43|
Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
Lev|25|44|
Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Lev|25|45|
Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
Lev|25|46|
And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
Lev|25|47|
And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
Lev|25|48|
After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
Lev|25|49|
Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
Lev|25|50|
And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
Lev|25|51|
If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
Lev|25|52|
And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
Lev|25|53|
And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
Lev|25|54|
And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.
Lev|25|55|
For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
