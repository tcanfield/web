Isa|38|1|
In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.
Isa|38|2|
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
Isa|38|3|
And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
Isa|38|4|
Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
Isa|38|5|
Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
Isa|38|6|
And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
Isa|38|7|
And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;
Isa|38|8|
Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
Isa|38|9|
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
Isa|38|10|
I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
Isa|38|11|
I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
Isa|38|12|
Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isa|38|13|
I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isa|38|14|
Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
Isa|38|15|
What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
Isa|38|16|
O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
Isa|38|17|
Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
Isa|38|18|
For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
Isa|38|19|
The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
Isa|38|20|
The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
Isa|38|21|
For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.
Isa|38|22|
Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
Isa|39|1|
At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
Isa|39|2|
And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
Isa|39|3|
Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
Isa|39|4|
Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
Isa|39|5|
Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
Isa|39|6|
Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
Isa|39|7|
And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
Isa|39|8|
Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.
Isa|40|1|
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
Isa|40|2|
Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.
Isa|40|3|
The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Isa|40|4|
Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
Isa|40|5|
And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
Isa|40|6|
The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:
Isa|40|7|
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.
Isa|40|8|
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
Isa|40|9|
O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
Isa|40|10|
Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
Isa|40|11|
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.
Isa|40|12|
Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
Isa|40|13|
Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?
Isa|40|14|
With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?
Isa|40|15|
Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
Isa|40|16|
And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
Isa|40|17|
All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
Isa|40|18|
To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
Isa|40|19|
The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
Isa|40|20|
He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
Isa|40|21|
Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
Isa|40|22|
It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
Isa|40|23|
That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
Isa|40|24|
Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
Isa|40|25|
To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.
Isa|40|26|
Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.
Isa|40|27|
Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?
Isa|40|28|
Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
Isa|40|29|
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
Isa|40|30|
Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
Isa|40|31|
But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.
