Psa|89|1|
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
Psa|89|2|
For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
Psa|89|3|
I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,
Psa|89|4|
Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
Psa|89|5|
And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
Psa|89|6|
For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
Psa|89|7|
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
Psa|89|8|
O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
Psa|89|9|
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
Psa|89|10|
Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
Psa|89|11|
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
Psa|89|12|
The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
Psa|89|13|
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Psa|89|14|
Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
Psa|89|15|
Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
Psa|89|16|
In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
Psa|89|17|
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
Psa|89|18|
For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.
Psa|89|19|
Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
Psa|89|20|
I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
Psa|89|21|
With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
Psa|89|22|
The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
Psa|89|23|
And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
Psa|89|24|
But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
Psa|89|25|
I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
Psa|89|26|
He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
Psa|89|27|
Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
Psa|89|28|
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
Psa|89|29|
His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
Psa|89|30|
If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
Psa|89|31|
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
Psa|89|32|
Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
Psa|89|33|
Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
Psa|89|34|
My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
Psa|89|35|
Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
Psa|89|36|
His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
Psa|89|37|
It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
Psa|89|38|
But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
Psa|89|39|
Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
Psa|89|40|
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
Psa|89|41|
All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
Psa|89|42|
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Psa|89|43|
Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
Psa|89|44|
Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
Psa|89|45|
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
Psa|89|46|
How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?
Psa|89|47|
Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
Psa|89|48|
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
Psa|89|49|
Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
Psa|89|50|
Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
Psa|89|51|
Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
Psa|89|52|
Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
Psa|90|1|
Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Psa|90|2|
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
Psa|90|3|
Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
Psa|90|4|
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
Psa|90|5|
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
Psa|90|6|
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
Psa|90|7|
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
Psa|90|8|
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
Psa|90|9|
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
Psa|90|10|
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Psa|90|11|
Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
Psa|90|12|
So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Psa|90|13|
Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
Psa|90|14|
O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Psa|90|15|
Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
Psa|90|16|
Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
Psa|90|17|
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
Psa|91|1|
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
Psa|91|2|
I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
Psa|91|3|
Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
Psa|91|4|
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Psa|91|5|
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
Psa|91|6|
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
Psa|91|7|
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
Psa|91|8|
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Psa|91|9|
Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
Psa|91|10|
There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
Psa|91|11|
For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
Psa|91|12|
They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Psa|91|13|
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
Psa|91|14|
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
Psa|91|15|
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
Psa|91|16|
With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
Psa|92|1|
IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:
Psa|92|2|
To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
Psa|92|3|
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
Psa|92|4|
For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
Psa|92|5|
O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
Psa|92|6|
A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
Psa|92|7|
When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
Psa|92|8|
But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
Psa|92|9|
For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
Psa|92|10|
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
Psa|92|11|
Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
Psa|92|12|
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Psa|92|13|
Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
Psa|92|14|
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
Psa|92|15|
To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
