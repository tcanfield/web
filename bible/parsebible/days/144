Job|39|1|
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
Job|39|2|
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
Job|39|3|
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
Job|39|4|
Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
Job|39|5|
Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
Job|39|6|
Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
Job|39|7|
He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
Job|39|8|
The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
Job|39|9|
Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
Job|39|10|
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
Job|39|11|
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
Job|39|12|
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
Job|39|13|
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
Job|39|14|
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
Job|39|15|
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
Job|39|16|
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;
Job|39|17|
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
Job|39|18|
What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
Job|39|19|
Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
Job|39|20|
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
Job|39|21|
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
Job|39|22|
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
Job|39|23|
The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
Job|39|24|
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
Job|39|25|
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
Job|39|26|
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
Job|39|27|
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
Job|39|28|
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
Job|39|29|
From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
Job|39|30|
Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
Job|40|1|
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,
Job|40|2|
Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
Job|40|3|
Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
Job|40|4|
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
Job|40|5|
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
Job|40|6|
Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job|40|7|
Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job|40|8|
Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
Job|40|9|
Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
Job|40|10|
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
Job|40|11|
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
Job|40|12|
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
Job|40|13|
Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
Job|40|14|
Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
Job|40|15|
Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
Job|40|16|
Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
Job|40|17|
He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
Job|40|18|
His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
Job|40|19|
He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
Job|40|20|
Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
Job|40|21|
He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
Job|40|22|
The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
Job|40|23|
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
Job|40|24|
He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
Job|41|1|
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
Job|41|2|
Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
Job|41|3|
Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
Job|41|4|
Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
Job|41|5|
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
Job|41|6|
Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
Job|41|7|
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
Job|41|8|
Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
Job|41|9|
Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
Job|41|10|
None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
Job|41|11|
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
Job|41|12|
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
Job|41|13|
Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
Job|41|14|
Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
Job|41|15|
His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
Job|41|16|
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
Job|41|17|
They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
Job|41|18|
By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Job|41|19|
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
Job|41|20|
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
Job|41|21|
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
Job|41|22|
In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
Job|41|23|
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
Job|41|24|
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
Job|41|25|
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
Job|41|26|
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
Job|41|27|
He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
Job|41|28|
The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
Job|41|29|
Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
Job|41|30|
Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
Job|41|31|
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
Job|41|32|
He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
Job|41|33|
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
Job|41|34|
He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
