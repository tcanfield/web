Isa|48|4|
Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
Isa|48|5|

Isa|48|10|
Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer?
