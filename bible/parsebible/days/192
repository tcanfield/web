Pro|4|1|
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
Pro|4|2|
For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
Pro|4|3|
For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
Pro|4|4|
He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
Pro|4|5|
Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Pro|4|6|
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
Pro|4|7|
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
Pro|4|8|
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
Pro|4|9|
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
Pro|4|10|
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
Pro|4|11|
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
Pro|4|12|
When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Pro|4|13|
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
Pro|4|14|
Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
Pro|4|15|
Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
Pro|4|16|
For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
Pro|4|17|
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
Pro|4|18|
But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
Pro|4|19|
The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
Pro|4|20|
My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
Pro|4|21|
Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
Pro|4|22|
For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
Pro|4|23|
Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
Pro|4|24|
Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
Pro|4|25|
Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
Pro|4|26|
Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
Pro|4|27|
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
Pro|5|1|
My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:
Pro|5|2|
That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
Pro|5|3|
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
Pro|5|4|
But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Pro|5|5|
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
Pro|5|6|
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
Pro|5|7|
Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
Pro|5|8|
Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
Pro|5|9|
Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
Pro|5|10|
Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
Pro|5|11|
And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
Pro|5|12|
And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
Pro|5|13|
And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
Pro|5|14|
I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Pro|5|15|
Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
Pro|5|16|
Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
Pro|5|17|
Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
Pro|5|18|
Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
Pro|5|19|
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
Pro|5|20|
And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
Pro|5|21|
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
Pro|5|22|
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
Pro|5|23|
He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
Pro|6|1|
My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
Pro|6|2|
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Pro|6|3|
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
Pro|6|4|
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
Pro|6|5|
Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Pro|6|6|
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
Pro|6|7|
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
Pro|6|8|
Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
Pro|6|9|
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
Pro|6|10|
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
Pro|6|11|
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
Pro|6|12|
A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
Pro|6|13|
He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
Pro|6|14|
Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
Pro|6|15|
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
Pro|6|16|
These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
Pro|6|17|
A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
Pro|6|18|
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
Pro|6|19|
A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
Pro|6|20|
My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Pro|6|21|
Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
Pro|6|22|
When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
Pro|6|23|
For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
Pro|6|24|
To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Pro|6|25|
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
Pro|6|26|
For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.
Pro|6|27|
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
Pro|6|28|
Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
Pro|6|29|
So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
Pro|6|30|
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
Pro|6|31|
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
Pro|6|32|
But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
Pro|6|33|
A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
Pro|6|34|
For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
Pro|6|35|
He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
