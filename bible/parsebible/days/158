Psa|44|1|
We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
Psa|44|2|
How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
Psa|44|3|
For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
Psa|44|4|
Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
Psa|44|5|
Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
Psa|44|6|
For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
Psa|44|7|
But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
Psa|44|8|
In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
Psa|44|9|
But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
Psa|44|10|
Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
Psa|44|11|
Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Psa|44|12|
Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
Psa|44|13|
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
Psa|44|14|
Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
Psa|44|15|
My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
Psa|44|16|
For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
Psa|44|17|
All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
Psa|44|18|
Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
Psa|44|19|
Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
Psa|44|20|
If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
Psa|44|21|
Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
Psa|44|22|
Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Psa|44|23|
Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.
Psa|44|24|
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
Psa|44|25|
For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
Psa|44|26|
Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
Psa|45|1|
My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Psa|45|2|
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
Psa|45|3|
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
Psa|45|4|
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
Psa|45|5|
Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.
Psa|45|6|
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Psa|45|7|
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Psa|45|8|
All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
Psa|45|9|
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
Psa|45|10|
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
Psa|45|11|
So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
Psa|45|12|
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
Psa|45|13|
The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
Psa|45|14|
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
Psa|45|15|
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
Psa|45|16|
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
Psa|45|17|
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
Psa|46|1|
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Psa|46|2|
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
Psa|46|3|
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
Psa|46|4|
There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
Psa|46|5|
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.
Psa|46|6|
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
Psa|46|7|
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
Psa|46|8|
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
Psa|46|9|
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
Psa|46|10|
Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
Psa|46|11|
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
