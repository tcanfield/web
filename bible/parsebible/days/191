Pro|1|1|
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
Pro|1|2|
To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
Pro|1|3|
To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
Pro|1|4|
To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
Pro|1|5|
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
Pro|1|6|
To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
Pro|1|7|
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
Pro|1|8|
My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Pro|1|9|
For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
Pro|1|10|
My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
Pro|1|11|
If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
Pro|1|12|
Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
Pro|1|13|
We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
Pro|1|14|
Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
Pro|1|15|
My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
Pro|1|16|
For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
Pro|1|17|
Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
Pro|1|18|
And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.
Pro|1|19|
So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Pro|1|20|
Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
Pro|1|21|
She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
Pro|1|22|
How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
Pro|1|23|
Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
Pro|1|24|
Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
Pro|1|25|
But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
Pro|1|26|
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
Pro|1|27|
When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
Pro|1|28|
Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
Pro|1|29|
For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
Pro|1|30|
They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
Pro|1|31|
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
Pro|1|32|
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
Pro|1|33|
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
Pro|2|1|
My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
Pro|2|2|
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
Pro|2|3|
Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
Pro|2|4|
If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
Pro|2|5|
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
Pro|2|6|
For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
Pro|2|7|
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
Pro|2|8|
He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
Pro|2|9|
Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
Pro|2|10|
When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
Pro|2|11|
Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
Pro|2|12|
To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;
Pro|2|13|
Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
Pro|2|14|
Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
Pro|2|15|
Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
Pro|2|16|
To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
Pro|2|17|
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
Pro|2|18|
For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
Pro|2|19|
None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
Pro|2|20|
That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
Pro|2|21|
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
Pro|2|22|
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
Pro|3|1|
My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
Pro|3|2|
For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
Pro|3|3|
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
Pro|3|4|
So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Pro|3|5|
Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
Pro|3|6|
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
Pro|3|7|
Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
Pro|3|8|
It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
Pro|3|9|
Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
Pro|3|10|
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
Pro|3|11|
My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
Pro|3|12|
For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Pro|3|13|
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
Pro|3|14|
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
Pro|3|15|
She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
Pro|3|16|
Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
Pro|3|17|
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
Pro|3|18|
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
Pro|3|19|
The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
Pro|3|20|
By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
Pro|3|21|
My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
Pro|3|22|
So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
Pro|3|23|
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
Pro|3|24|
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Pro|3|25|
Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
Pro|3|26|
For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
Pro|3|27|
Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
Pro|3|28|
Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
Pro|3|29|
Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Pro|3|30|
Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
Pro|3|31|
Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
Pro|3|32|
For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
Pro|3|33|
The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
Pro|3|34|
Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
Pro|3|35|
The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
