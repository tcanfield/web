Psa|21|1|
The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
Psa|21|2|
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
Psa|21|3|
For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
Psa|21|4|
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
Psa|21|5|
His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
Psa|21|6|
For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
Psa|21|7|
For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
Psa|21|8|
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
Psa|21|9|
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Psa|21|10|
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
Psa|21|11|
For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
Psa|21|12|
Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
Psa|21|13|
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
Psa|22|1|
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
Psa|22|2|
O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
Psa|22|3|
But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
Psa|22|4|
Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
Psa|22|5|
They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
Psa|22|6|
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
Psa|22|7|
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
Psa|22|8|
He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
Psa|22|9|
But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.
Psa|22|10|
I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.
Psa|22|11|
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
Psa|22|12|
Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
Psa|22|13|
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
Psa|22|14|
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
Psa|22|15|
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
Psa|22|16|
For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
Psa|22|17|
I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
Psa|22|18|
They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
Psa|22|19|
But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
Psa|22|20|
Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
Psa|22|21|
Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
Psa|22|22|
I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
Psa|22|23|
Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
Psa|22|24|
For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
Psa|22|25|
My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
Psa|22|26|
The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
Psa|22|27|
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
Psa|22|28|
For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.
Psa|22|29|
All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
Psa|22|30|
A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
Psa|22|31|
They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
Psa|23|1|
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
Psa|23|2|
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
Psa|23|3|
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Psa|23|4|
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Psa|23|5|
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Psa|23|6|
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
