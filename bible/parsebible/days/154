Psa|30|1|
I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
Psa|30|2|
O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
Psa|30|3|
O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Psa|30|4|
Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
Psa|30|5|
For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
Psa|30|6|
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
Psa|30|7|
LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
Psa|30|8|
I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
Psa|30|9|
What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
Psa|30|10|
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
Psa|30|11|
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
Psa|30|12|
To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
Psa|31|1|
In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.
Psa|31|2|
Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
Psa|31|3|
For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
Psa|31|4|
Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.
Psa|31|5|
Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.
Psa|31|6|
I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.
Psa|31|7|
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
Psa|31|8|
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.
Psa|31|9|
Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.
Psa|31|10|
For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
Psa|31|11|
I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
Psa|31|12|
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
Psa|31|13|
For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
Psa|31|14|
But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
Psa|31|15|
My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
Psa|31|16|
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.
Psa|31|17|
Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.
Psa|31|18|
Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
Psa|31|19|
Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
Psa|31|20|
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
Psa|31|21|
Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
Psa|31|22|
For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
Psa|31|23|
O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
Psa|31|24|
Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
Psa|32|1|
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Psa|32|2|
Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
Psa|32|3|
When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
Psa|32|4|
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
Psa|32|5|
I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
Psa|32|6|
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
Psa|32|7|
Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
Psa|32|8|
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
Psa|32|9|
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
Psa|32|10|
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
Psa|32|11|
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
Psa|33|1|
Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.
Psa|33|2|
Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
Psa|33|3|
Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
Psa|33|4|
For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.
Psa|33|5|
He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
Psa|33|6|
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
Psa|33|7|
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
Psa|33|8|
Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
Psa|33|9|
For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
Psa|33|10|
The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
Psa|33|11|
The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Psa|33|12|
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
Psa|33|13|
The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
Psa|33|14|
From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
Psa|33|15|
He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
Psa|33|16|
There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
Psa|33|17|
An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
Psa|33|18|
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
Psa|33|19|
To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Psa|33|20|
Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
Psa|33|21|
For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
Psa|33|22|
Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
