Act|21|1|
And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
Act|21|2|
And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
Act|21|3|
Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
Act|21|4|
And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
Act|21|5|
And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
Act|21|6|
And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
Act|21|7|
And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
Act|21|8|
And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.
Act|21|9|
And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
Act|21|10|
And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
Act|21|11|
And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Act|21|12|
And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Act|21|13|
Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?  for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Act|21|14|
And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Act|21|15|
And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.
Act|21|16|
There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
Act|21|17|
And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
Act|21|18|
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
Act|21|19|
And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
Act|21|20|
And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
Act|21|21|
And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.
Act|21|22|
What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
Act|21|23|
Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
Act|21|24|
Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
Act|21|25|
As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
Act|21|26|
Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
Act|21|27|
And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
Act|21|28|
Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
Act|21|29|
(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
Act|21|30|
And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
Act|21|31|
And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
Act|21|32|
Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
Act|21|33|
Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
Act|21|34|
And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
Act|21|35|
And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
Act|21|36|
For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
Act|21|37|
And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
Act|21|38|
Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
Act|21|39|
But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
Act|21|40|
And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
Act|22|1|
Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.
Act|22|2|
(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
Act|22|3|
I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
Act|22|4|
And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
Act|22|5|
As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
Act|22|6|
And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
Act|22|7|
And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Act|22|8|
And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
Act|22|9|
And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
Act|22|10|
And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Act|22|11|
And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
Act|22|12|
And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,
Act|22|13|
Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
Act|22|14|
And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
Act|22|15|
For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
Act|22|16|
And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
Act|22|17|
And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
Act|22|18|
And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
Act|22|19|
And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
Act|22|20|
And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
Act|22|21|
And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
Act|22|22|
And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
Act|22|23|
And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,
Act|22|24|
The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
Act|22|25|
And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
Act|22|26|
When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
Act|22|27|
Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
Act|22|28|
And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
Act|22|29|
Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
Act|22|30|
On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
Act|23|1|
And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
Act|23|2|
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
Act|23|3|
Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
Act|23|4|
And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?
Act|23|5|
Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
Act|23|6|
But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
Act|23|7|
And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
Act|23|8|
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
Act|23|9|
And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
Act|23|10|
And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.
Act|23|11|
And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
Act|23|12|
And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
Act|23|13|
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
Act|23|14|
And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
Act|23|15|
Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
Act|23|16|
And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
Act|23|17|
Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
Act|23|18|
So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
Act|23|19|
Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
Act|23|20|
And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
Act|23|21|
But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
Act|23|22|
So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.
Act|23|23|
And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
Act|23|24|
And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.
Act|23|25|
And he wrote a letter after this manner:
Act|23|26|
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
Act|23|27|
This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
Act|23|28|
And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
Act|23|29|
Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
Act|23|30|
And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.
Act|23|31|
Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Act|23|32|
On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
Act|23|33|
Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
Act|23|34|
And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;
Act|23|35|
I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
