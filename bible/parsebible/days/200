Pro|30|1|
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
Pro|30|2|
Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.
Pro|30|3|
I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
Pro|30|4|
Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?
Pro|30|5|
Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
Pro|30|6|
Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
Pro|30|7|
Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:
Pro|30|8|
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
Pro|30|9|
Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
Pro|30|10|
Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
Pro|30|11|
There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
Pro|30|12|
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
Pro|30|13|
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
Pro|30|14|
There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
Pro|30|15|
The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:
Pro|30|16|
The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.
Pro|30|17|
The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
Pro|30|18|
There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
Pro|30|19|
The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
Pro|30|20|
Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
Pro|30|21|
For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:
Pro|30|22|
For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
Pro|30|23|
For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
Pro|30|24|
There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
Pro|30|25|
The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
Pro|30|26|
The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
Pro|30|27|
The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
Pro|30|28|
The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
Pro|30|29|
There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
Pro|30|30|
A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
Pro|30|31|
A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
Pro|30|32|
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
Pro|30|33|
Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
Pro|31|1|
The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
Pro|31|2|
What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
Pro|31|3|
Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
Pro|31|4|
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
Pro|31|5|
Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
Pro|31|6|
Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
Pro|31|7|
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
Pro|31|8|
Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
Pro|31|9|
Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
Pro|31|10|
Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.
Pro|31|11|
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
Pro|31|12|
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
Pro|31|13|
She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
Pro|31|14|
She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
Pro|31|15|
She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
Pro|31|16|
She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
Pro|31|17|
She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
Pro|31|18|
She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.
Pro|31|19|
She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
Pro|31|20|
She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
Pro|31|21|
She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
Pro|31|22|
She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.
Pro|31|23|
Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
Pro|31|24|
She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
Pro|31|25|
Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
Pro|31|26|
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
Pro|31|27|
She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
Pro|31|28|
Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
Pro|31|29|
Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
Pro|31|30|
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
Pro|31|31|
Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
Ecc|1|1|
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
Ecc|1|2|
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
Ecc|1|3|
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
Ecc|1|4|
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
Ecc|1|5|
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
Ecc|1|7|
All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
Ecc|1|8|
All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
Ecc|1|9|
The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Ecc|1|10|

Ecc|1|11|
There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.
Ecc|1|12|
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecc|1|13|
And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
Ecc|1|14|
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
Ecc|1|15|
That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
Ecc|1|16|
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
Ecc|1|17|
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
Ecc|1|18|
For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
