Psa|72|1|
Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
Psa|72|2|
He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
Psa|72|3|
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
Psa|72|4|
He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
Psa|72|5|
They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
Psa|72|6|
He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.
Psa|72|7|
In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
Psa|72|8|
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
Psa|72|9|
They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
Psa|72|10|
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Psa|72|11|
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
Psa|72|12|
For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
Psa|72|13|
He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
Psa|72|14|
He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
Psa|72|15|
And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
Psa|72|16|
There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
Psa|72|17|
His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
Psa|72|18|
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
Psa|72|19|
And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
Psa|72|20|
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
Psa|73|1|
Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
Psa|73|2|
But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
Psa|73|3|
For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
Psa|73|4|
For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
Psa|73|5|
They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
Psa|73|6|
Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
Psa|73|7|
Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
Psa|73|8|
They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
Psa|73|9|
They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
Psa|73|10|
Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
Psa|73|11|
And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
Psa|73|12|
Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
Psa|73|13|
Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
Psa|73|14|
For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
Psa|73|15|
If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
Psa|73|16|
When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
Psa|73|17|
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
Psa|73|18|
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
Psa|73|19|
How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
Psa|73|20|
As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
Psa|73|21|
Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
Psa|73|22|
So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
Psa|73|23|
Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Psa|73|24|
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
Psa|73|25|
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
Psa|73|26|
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
Psa|73|27|
For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
Psa|73|28|
But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
Psa|74|1|
O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
Psa|74|2|
Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
Psa|74|3|
Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
Psa|74|4|
Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
Psa|74|5|
A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
Psa|74|6|
But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
Psa|74|7|
They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
Psa|74|8|
They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
Psa|74|9|
We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
Psa|74|10|
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
Psa|74|11|
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
Psa|74|12|
For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
Psa|74|13|
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
Psa|74|14|
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
Psa|74|15|
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
Psa|74|16|
The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Psa|74|17|
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Psa|74|18|
Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
Psa|74|19|
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
Psa|74|20|
Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
Psa|74|21|
O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
Psa|74|22|
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
Psa|74|23|
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
