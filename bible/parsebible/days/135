Job|8|1|
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|8|2|
How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
Job|8|3|
Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
Job|8|4|
If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
Job|8|5|
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
Job|8|6|
If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
Job|8|7|
Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
Job|8|8|
For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
Job|8|9|
(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
Job|8|10|
Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
Job|8|11|
Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
Job|8|12|
Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
Job|8|13|
So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
Job|8|14|
Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
Job|8|15|
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
Job|8|16|
He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
Job|8|17|
His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
Job|8|18|
If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
Job|8|19|
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
Job|8|20|
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
Job|8|21|
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
Job|8|22|
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
Job|9|1|
Then Job answered and said,
Job|9|2|
I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
Job|9|3|
If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
Job|9|4|
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
Job|9|5|
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
Job|9|6|
Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
Job|9|7|
Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
Job|9|8|
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
Job|9|9|
Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
Job|9|10|
Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
Job|9|11|
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
Job|9|12|
Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
Job|9|13|
If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
Job|9|14|
How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
Job|9|15|
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
Job|9|16|
If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
Job|9|17|
For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
Job|9|18|
He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
Job|9|19|
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
Job|9|20|
If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
Job|9|21|
Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
Job|9|22|
This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
Job|9|23|
If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
Job|9|24|
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
Job|9|25|
Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
Job|9|26|
They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
Job|9|27|
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
Job|9|28|
I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
Job|9|29|
If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?
Job|9|30|
If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
Job|9|31|
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
Job|9|32|
For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.
Job|9|33|
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
Job|9|34|
Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
Job|9|35|
Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
Job|10|1|
My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job|10|2|
I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
Job|10|3|
Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
Job|10|4|
Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
Job|10|5|
Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,
Job|10|6|
That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
Job|10|7|
Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.
Job|10|8|
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
Job|10|9|
Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
Job|10|10|
Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
Job|10|11|
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
Job|10|12|
Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
Job|10|13|
And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.
Job|10|14|
If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
Job|10|15|
If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
Job|10|16|
For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
Job|10|17|
Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
Job|10|18|
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
Job|10|19|
I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job|10|20|
Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
Job|10|21|
Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
Job|10|22|
A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
