Psa|139|1|
O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.
Psa|139|2|
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
Psa|139|3|
Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
Psa|139|4|
For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
Psa|139|5|
Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
Psa|139|6|
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
Psa|139|7|
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
Psa|139|8|
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
Psa|139|9|
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Psa|139|10|
Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
Psa|139|11|
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
Psa|139|12|
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
Psa|139|13|
For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
Psa|139|14|
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
Psa|139|15|
My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
Psa|139|16|
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
Psa|139|17|
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
Psa|139|18|
If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
Psa|139|19|
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
Psa|139|20|
For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
Psa|139|21|
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
Psa|139|22|
I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
Psa|139|23|
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
Psa|139|24|
And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
Psa|140|1|
Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
Psa|140|2|
Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.
Psa|140|3|
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.
Psa|140|4|
Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
Psa|140|5|
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
Psa|140|6|
I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
Psa|140|7|
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
Psa|140|8|
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.
Psa|140|9|
As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
Psa|140|10|
Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
Psa|140|11|
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
Psa|140|12|
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.
Psa|140|13|
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
Psa|141|1|
Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
Psa|141|2|
Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
Psa|141|3|
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
Psa|141|4|
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
Psa|141|5|
Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
Psa|141|6|
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
Psa|141|7|
Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
Psa|141|8|
But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
Psa|141|9|
Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
Psa|141|10|
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
