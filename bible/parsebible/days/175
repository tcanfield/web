Psa|100|1|
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
Psa|100|2|
Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
Psa|100|3|
Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Psa|100|4|
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
Psa|100|5|
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
Psa|101|1|
I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.
Psa|101|2|
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
Psa|101|3|
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
Psa|101|4|
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Psa|101|5|
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
Psa|101|6|
Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
Psa|101|7|
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
Psa|101|8|
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
Psa|102|1|
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
Psa|102|2|
Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.
Psa|102|3|
For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
Psa|102|4|
My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
Psa|102|5|
By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
Psa|102|6|
I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
Psa|102|7|
I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
Psa|102|8|
Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
Psa|102|9|
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.
Psa|102|10|
Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
Psa|102|11|
My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
Psa|102|12|
But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.
Psa|102|13|
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
Psa|102|14|
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
Psa|102|15|
So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
Psa|102|16|
When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.
Psa|102|17|
He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
Psa|102|18|
This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
Psa|102|19|
For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
Psa|102|20|
To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
Psa|102|21|
To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
Psa|102|22|
When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
Psa|102|23|
He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
Psa|102|24|
I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.
Psa|102|25|
Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
Psa|102|26|
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
Psa|102|27|
But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
Psa|102|28|
The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
