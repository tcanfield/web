The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Isa|1|2|
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
Isa|1|3|
The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
Isa|1|4|
Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
Isa|1|5|
Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
Isa|1|6|
From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
Isa|1|7|
Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
Isa|1|8|
And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
Isa|1|9|
Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
Isa|1|10|
Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
Isa|1|11|
To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
Isa|1|12|
When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
Isa|1|13|
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
Isa|1|14|
Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
Isa|1|15|
And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
Isa|1|16|
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
Isa|1|17|
Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

Isa|1|20|
But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
Isa|1|21|
How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
Isa|1|22|
Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
Isa|1|23|
Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
Isa|1|24|
Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
Isa|1|25|
And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
Isa|1|26|
And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
Isa|2|4|
And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
Isa|2|5|
O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
Isa|2|6|
Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
Isa|2|7|
Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:
Isa|2|8|

Isa|2|13|
And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
Isa|2|14|
And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
Isa|2|15|
And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,
Isa|2|16|
And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

Isa|3|2|
The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
Isa|3|3|

Isa|3|4|

Isa|3|6|
When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:
Isa|3|7|
In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
Isa|3|8|
For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.
Isa|3|18|
In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,
Isa|3|19|
The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
Isa|3|20|
The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
Isa|3|21|
The rings, and nose jewels,
Isa|3|22|
The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
Isa|3|23|
The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
Isa|3|24|
And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.

Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
