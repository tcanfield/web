Mat|23|1|
Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
Mat|23|2|
Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:
Mat|23|3|
All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
Mat|23|4|
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
Mat|23|5|
But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
Mat|23|6|
And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
Mat|23|7|
And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
Mat|23|8|
But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.
Mat|23|9|
And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
Mat|23|10|
Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.
Mat|23|11|
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Mat|23|12|
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
Mat|23|13|
But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
Mat|23|14|
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
Mat|23|15|
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Mat|23|16|
Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
Mat|23|17|
Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
Mat|23|18|
And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
Mat|23|19|
Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
Mat|23|20|
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
Mat|23|21|
And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
Mat|23|22|
And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
Mat|23|23|
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Mat|23|24|
Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
Mat|23|25|
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
Mat|23|26|
Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
Mat|23|27|
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
Mat|23|28|
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Mat|23|29|
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
Mat|23|30|
And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Mat|23|31|
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.
Mat|23|32|
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
Mat|23|33|
Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
Mat|23|34|
Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:
Mat|23|35|
That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
Mat|23|36|
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
Mat|23|37|
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
Mat|23|38|
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
Mat|23|39|
For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Mat|24|1|
And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
Mat|24|2|
And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Mat|24|3|
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
Mat|24|4|
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
Mat|24|5|
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
Mat|24|6|
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
Mat|24|7|
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
Mat|24|8|
All these are the beginning of sorrows.
Mat|24|9|
Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
Mat|24|10|
And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
Mat|24|11|
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
Mat|24|12|
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
Mat|24|13|
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
Mat|24|14|
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
Mat|24|15|
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)
Mat|24|16|
Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
Mat|24|17|
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
Mat|24|18|
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.
Mat|24|19|
And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
Mat|24|20|
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:
Mat|24|21|
For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
Mat|24|22|
And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.
Mat|24|23|
Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.
Mat|24|24|
For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
Mat|24|25|
Behold, I have told you before.
Mat|24|26|
Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.
Mat|24|27|
For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Mat|24|28|
For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
Mat|24|29|
Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
Mat|24|30|
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Mat|24|31|
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Mat|24|32|
Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
Mat|24|33|
So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
Mat|24|34|
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
Mat|24|35|
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
Mat|24|36|
But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
Mat|24|37|
But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Mat|24|38|
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
Mat|24|39|
And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Mat|24|40|
Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Mat|24|41|
Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Mat|24|42|
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
Mat|24|43|
But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
Mat|24|44|
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Mat|24|45|
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
Mat|24|46|
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Mat|24|47|
Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
Mat|24|48|
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
Mat|24|49|
And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
Mat|24|50|
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
Mat|24|51|
And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Mat|25|1|
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Mat|25|2|
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
Mat|25|3|
They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
Mat|25|4|
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Mat|25|5|
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Mat|25|6|
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
Mat|25|7|
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Mat|25|8|
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
Mat|25|9|
But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
Mat|25|10|
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
Mat|25|11|
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
Mat|25|12|
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Mat|25|13|
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
Mat|25|14|
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
Mat|25|15|
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
Mat|25|16|
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
Mat|25|17|
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
Mat|25|18|
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
Mat|25|19|
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
Mat|25|20|
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
Mat|25|21|
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Mat|25|22|
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
Mat|25|23|
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Mat|25|24|
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
Mat|25|25|
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
Mat|25|26|
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
Mat|25|27|
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
Mat|25|28|
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
Mat|25|29|
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Mat|25|30|
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Mat|25|31|
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
Mat|25|32|
And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
Mat|25|33|
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Mat|25|34|
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
Mat|25|35|
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
Mat|25|36|
Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Mat|25|37|
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
Mat|25|38|
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
Mat|25|39|
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
Mat|25|40|
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
Mat|25|41|
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
Mat|25|42|
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
Mat|25|43|
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Mat|25|44|
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Mat|25|45|
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
Mat|25|46|
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
