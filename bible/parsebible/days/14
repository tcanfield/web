Gen|48|1|
And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Gen|48|2|
And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
Gen|48|3|
And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Gen|48|4|
And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
Gen|48|5|
And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
Gen|48|6|
And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
Gen|48|7|
And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
Gen|48|8|
And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
Gen|48|9|
And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
Gen|48|10|
Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
Gen|48|11|
And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
Gen|48|12|
And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
Gen|48|13|
And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
Gen|48|14|
And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
Gen|48|15|
And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
Gen|48|16|
The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Gen|48|17|
And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
Gen|48|18|
And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
Gen|48|19|
And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
Gen|48|20|
And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Gen|48|21|
And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
Gen|48|22|
Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
Gen|49|1|
And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
Gen|49|2|
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
Gen|49|3|
Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
Gen|49|4|
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
Gen|49|5|
Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
Gen|49|6|
O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
Gen|49|7|
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
Gen|49|8|
Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
Gen|49|9|
Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
Gen|49|10|
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
Gen|49|11|
Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
Gen|49|12|
His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
Gen|49|13|
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
Gen|49|14|
Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
Gen|49|15|
And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
Gen|49|16|
Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
Gen|49|17|
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
Gen|49|18|
I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
Gen|49|19|
Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
Gen|49|20|
Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
Gen|49|21|
Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
Gen|49|22|
Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
Gen|49|23|
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
Gen|49|24|
But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
Gen|49|25|
Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
Gen|49|26|
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Gen|49|27|
Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
Gen|49|28|
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
Gen|49|29|
And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Gen|49|30|
In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
Gen|49|31|
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
Gen|49|32|
The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
Gen|49|33|
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
Gen|50|1|
And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
Gen|50|2|
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
Gen|50|3|
And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
Gen|50|4|
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Gen|50|5|
My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
Gen|50|6|
And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
Gen|50|7|
And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Gen|50|8|
And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
Gen|50|9|
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
Gen|50|10|
And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
Gen|50|11|
And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
Gen|50|12|
And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
Gen|50|13|
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
Gen|50|14|
And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
Gen|50|15|
And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
Gen|50|16|
And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
Gen|50|17|
So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
Gen|50|18|
And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
Gen|50|19|
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Gen|50|20|
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
Gen|50|21|
Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
Gen|50|22|
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
Gen|50|23|
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
Gen|50|24|
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Gen|50|25|
And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
Gen|50|26|
So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
Exo|1|1|
Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
Exo|1|2|
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Exo|1|3|
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Exo|1|4|
Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
Exo|1|5|
And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
Exo|1|6|
And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
Exo|1|7|
And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
Exo|1|8|
Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
Exo|1|9|
And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
Exo|1|10|
Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
Exo|1|11|
Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
Exo|1|12|
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
Exo|1|13|
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
Exo|1|14|
And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.
Exo|1|15|
And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
Exo|1|16|
And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
Exo|1|17|
But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
Exo|1|18|
And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
Exo|1|19|
And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
Exo|1|20|
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
Exo|1|21|
And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
Exo|1|22|
And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
