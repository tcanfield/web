Sol|6|1|
Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
Sol|6|2|
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
Sol|6|3|
I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
Sol|6|4|
Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
Sol|6|5|
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
Sol|6|6|
Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.
Sol|6|7|
As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.
Sol|6|8|
There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
Sol|6|9|
My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
Sol|6|10|
Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?
Sol|6|11|
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.
Sol|6|12|
Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
Sol|6|13|
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
Sol|7|1|
How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
Sol|7|2|
Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
Sol|7|3|
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
Sol|7|4|
Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
Sol|7|5|
Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.
Sol|7|6|
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
Sol|7|7|
This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
Sol|7|8|
I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
Sol|7|9|
And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
Sol|7|10|
I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
Sol|7|11|
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
Sol|7|12|
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.
Sol|7|13|
The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
Sol|8|1|
O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!  when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
Sol|8|2|
I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
Sol|8|3|
His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
Sol|8|4|
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
Sol|8|5|
Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
Sol|8|6|
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.
Sol|8|7|
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
Sol|8|8|
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
Sol|8|9|
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
Sol|8|10|
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
Sol|8|11|
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
Sol|8|12|
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
Sol|8|13|
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.
Sol|8|14|
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
