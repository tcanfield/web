Gen|7|13|
In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
Gen|7|14|
They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
Gen|7|15|
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
Gen|7|16|
And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
Gen|7|17|
And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
Gen|7|18|
And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
Gen|7|19|
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
Gen|7|20|
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
Gen|7|21|
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
Gen|7|22|
All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
Gen|7|23|
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
Gen|7|24|
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
