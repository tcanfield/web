Deu|32|1|
Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
Deu|32|2|
My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:
Deu|32|3|
Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
Deu|32|4|
He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.
Deu|32|5|
They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.
Deu|32|6|
Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?
Deu|32|7|
Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.
Deu|32|8|
When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
Deu|32|9|
For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
Deu|32|10|
He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
Deu|32|11|
As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:
Deu|32|12|
So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
Deu|32|13|
He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
Deu|32|14|
Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
Deu|32|15|
But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
Deu|32|16|
They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.
Deu|32|17|
They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.
Deu|32|18|
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.
Deu|32|19|
And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
Deu|32|20|
And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.
Deu|32|21|
They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
Deu|32|22|
For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
Deu|32|23|
I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
Deu|32|24|
They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
Deu|32|25|
The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
Deu|32|26|
I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
Deu|32|27|
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.
Deu|32|28|
For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.
Deu|32|29|
O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
Deu|32|30|
How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?
Deu|32|31|
For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
Deu|32|32|
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:
Deu|32|33|
Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
Deu|32|34|
Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?
Deu|32|35|
To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
Deu|32|36|
For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.
Deu|32|37|
And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
Deu|32|38|
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
Deu|32|39|
See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
Deu|32|40|
For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
Deu|32|41|
If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
Deu|32|42|
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
Deu|32|43|
Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.
Deu|32|44|
And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
Deu|32|45|
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
Deu|32|46|
And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
Deu|32|47|
For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
Deu|32|48|
And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
Deu|32|49|
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
Deu|32|50|
And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
Deu|32|51|
Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
Deu|32|52|
Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
Deu|33|1|
And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
Deu|33|2|
And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.
Deu|33|3|
Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.
Deu|33|4|
Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
Deu|33|5|
And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
Deu|33|6|
Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.
Deu|33|7|
And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.
Deu|33|8|
And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
Deu|33|9|
Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
Deu|33|10|
They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.
Deu|33|11|
Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
Deu|33|12|
And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
Deu|33|13|
And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
Deu|33|14|
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
Deu|33|15|
And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
Deu|33|16|
And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
Deu|33|17|
His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
Deu|33|18|
And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.
Deu|33|19|
They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.
Deu|33|20|
And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.
Deu|33|21|
And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.
Deu|33|22|
And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.
Deu|33|23|
And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.
Deu|33|24|
And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
Deu|33|25|
Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
Deu|33|26|
There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.
Deu|33|27|
The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.
Deu|33|28|
Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.
Deu|33|29|
Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
Deu|34|1|
And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,
Deu|34|2|
And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,
Deu|34|3|
And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.
Deu|34|4|
And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.
Deu|34|5|
So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
Deu|34|6|
And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
Deu|34|7|
And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
Deu|34|8|
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
Deu|34|9|
And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Deu|34|10|
And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
Deu|34|11|
In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
Deu|34|12|
And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.
