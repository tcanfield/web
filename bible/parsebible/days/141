Job|29|1|
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
Job|29|2|
Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
Job|29|3|
When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
Job|29|4|
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
Job|29|5|
When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
Job|29|6|
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
Job|29|7|
When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
Job|29|8|
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
Job|29|9|
The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
Job|29|10|
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
Job|29|11|
When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
Job|29|12|
Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
Job|29|13|
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
Job|29|14|
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
Job|29|15|
I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
Job|29|16|
I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
Job|29|17|
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
Job|29|18|
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
Job|29|19|
My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
Job|29|20|
My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
Job|29|21|
Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
Job|29|22|
After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
Job|29|23|
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
Job|29|24|
If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
Job|29|25|
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
Job|30|1|
But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
Job|30|2|
Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
Job|30|3|
For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
Job|30|4|
Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.
Job|30|5|
They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
Job|30|6|
To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
Job|30|7|
Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
Job|30|8|
They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
Job|30|9|
And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
Job|30|10|
They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
Job|30|11|
Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
Job|30|12|
Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
Job|30|13|
They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
Job|30|14|
They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
Job|30|15|
Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
Job|30|16|
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job|30|17|
My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
Job|30|18|
By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job|30|19|
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
Job|30|20|
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
Job|30|21|
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
Job|30|22|
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
Job|30|23|
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
Job|30|24|
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
Job|30|25|
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
Job|30|26|
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
Job|30|27|
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
Job|30|28|
I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
Job|30|29|
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
Job|30|30|
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
Job|30|31|
My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
Job|31|1|
I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
Job|31|2|
For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Job|31|3|
Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
Job|31|4|
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
Job|31|5|
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
Job|31|6|
Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.
Job|31|7|
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
Job|31|8|
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
Job|31|9|
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
Job|31|10|
Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
Job|31|11|
For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
Job|31|12|
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
Job|31|13|
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
Job|31|14|
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
Job|31|15|
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job|31|16|
If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
Job|31|17|
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
Job|31|18|
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
Job|31|19|
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
Job|31|20|
If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
Job|31|21|
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
Job|31|22|
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
Job|31|23|
For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
Job|31|24|
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
Job|31|25|
If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
Job|31|26|
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
Job|31|27|
And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
Job|31|28|
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
Job|31|29|
If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
Job|31|30|
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
Job|31|31|
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh!  we cannot be satisfied.
Job|31|32|
The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
Job|31|33|
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
Job|31|34|
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
Job|31|35|
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
Job|31|36|
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
Job|31|37|
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job|31|38|
If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
Job|31|39|
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
Job|31|40|
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
